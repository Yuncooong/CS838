{Yup dduk La} is known for their spicy challenge rice cakes.  You have an option of either more fish cake or more rice cake, I went with more fish cake and extra mild.  Not too bad.  The spicy level in {Yup Dduk La} is perfect for me, spicy but not too spicy.  I love it and it's actually really sweet and lots of [goodies] you can add to it.  I would recommend it if you love {Yup Dduk La}
