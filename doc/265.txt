Tucked in a remodeled 1924 Craftsman-style firehouse in the peaceful community of Silver Lake, the {Edendale} offers exquisite cuisine in a comfortable, unassuming setting. Accented with fresh flower arrangements, cozy armchairs, antique sconces and walls of old black and white photos, [the setting has] the potential to make single diners and large groups alike feel like they are home. As is only fitting in this comforting setting, Executive Chef Paul Downer offers [an amazing array] of comforting dishes including Ahi Tartare, a Fried Green Tomato Salad, and the signature {Edendale} Creamy Baked Macaroni and Cheese with chili garlic bread crumbs that guests can add bacon or jalapenos should they desire.
