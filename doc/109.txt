{Destroyer} is here from the future, to show you what a cafe looks like in 2050. Interiors are as minimal as it gets (bright white walls, the menu projected onto a wall), until you reach the built-in coffee machine that could possibly be launch control for a nuclear arsenal. The biggest surprise of {Destroyer} though is the food - it looks modern and interesting and tastes delicious. The raw oatmeal of {Destroyer} sounds like something a righteous vegan would eat, but it's way better than what a righteous vegan would eat.
