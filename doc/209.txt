{CUT} restaurant, the newest addition to the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons, has created a sense of chic within the hotelâ€™s former classically modeled dining room. Designed by architect Richard Meier, {CUT} is large, lustrous, and smooth, [with oak floors], black-and-white trimmings, and curling vines budding alongside the walls of the two-level fortress. The menu offers USDA Prime, Kobe beef, and true Japanese 100% Wagyu beef from [Kagoshima], all of which are complemented by an assortment of tangy sauces, [an array of vegetables], and a smart wine list. The elegance of {CUT} is sure to impress.
