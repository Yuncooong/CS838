A hop, skip, and a jump down from the main thoroughfare of Santa Monica Boulevard in Santa Monica, you'll find {La Botte}. Meaning “wine bottle” in Italian, {La Botte} is owner Stefano de Lorenzo’s upgraded version of his popular, [postage-stamp-sized Piccolo Ristorante] in neighboring Venice. The wine concept glows in a warmly elegant décor of variegated wine stained wood flooring and wine cask wainscoting. A “vino paradiso” exists in {La Botte’s} 1,600 bottles of wine. Chef [Luigi Fineo] creatively infuses contemporary freshness into the Northern Italian appetizers, pasta, and entrees for an authentic Italian dining experience that will have you begging for more.
