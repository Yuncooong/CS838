After seven years of success in the North Hollywood Arts District, Paul Hibler and David Sanfield took their {Pitfire Pizza} concept downtown in 2005. Across from St. [Vibiana’s] Cathedral and in the shadow of skyscrapers, office workers flood this modern Italian café at lunch for thin-crust pizzas, [hearty pastas], and market-fresh salads. At night and on weekends, the rush subsides and {Pitfire} offers a more relaxed dining experience with the same value. Order at the counter, where a board lists seasonal specials and fresh-baked desserts are on display. To drink, there’s [fresh sangria] and watermelon lemonade, plus wine and beer.
