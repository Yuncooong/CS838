I¡¯m sure everyone has their own "essential" [restaurant], but since both of my boys are vegetarian I found {Gracias Madre}. My boys have declared {Gracias Madre} the best vegetarian place ever! Wonderful even for an omnivore like dad. And the famous people that eat there make it a fun place to people watch. I guess [necessity] is also the mother of exploration.
