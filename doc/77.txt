It's true, {Iron Chef Morimoto's} quick-casual Pan-Asian inside LAX is suffering at the mouths of Yelpers. Lillian C. is surprised, "I can't believe this place has {Morimoto's} name on it... I mean... SERIOUSLY? ... We ordered some skewers with [rice] and the portions were not only tiny, it was expensive and bland." Brandon S. says "It was [extremely] dry ... it was like eating beef jerky." Finally, Mark A. has a recommendation, "{McDonalds} across the hall is better."
