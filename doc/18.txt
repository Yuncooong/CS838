Frogtown hasn't had a [great restaurant], which makes {Salazar's} landing last year all the more impressive. {Salazar's} a [Sonoran-style] taco joint, which means grilled [carne asada] and other meats served on [flour tortillas]. The vegetables and other dishes are also delightful, but nothing beats that ambiance: an oasis in the concrete jungle of Los Angeles.
