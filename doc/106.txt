{Mar Vista} is one of those neighborhoods that has a lot of cute houses, but not a whole lot else. So the opening of The {Mar Vista} has made a lot of Mar Vistans ([Mar Vistenos]?) very happy. This big, bright space of {Mar Vista} on Venice Boulevard has quickly become a neighborhood hangout, with tables that work for groups, and lots of space to drop in and grab a meal at the bar. The menu seems kind of all over the place as you read it - there's everything from a fontina bacon crab melt and ceviche, to hot pots and a short rib ragu. But somehow it all works, and it turns out it's a relief to read a menu on the Westside that doesn't include the words "brussels sprouts."
