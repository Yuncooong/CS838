With several excellent {DTLA} taco spots now open, it¡¯s not easy to pick just one, but our favorite is definitely Sonoratown. This tiny, [order-at-the-counter] taco spot is a bit removed from the main downtown hustle, but it¡¯s worth the extra few blocks walk. All the {DTLA} taco are made in-house and the carne asada is phenomenal. And it¡¯s just nice to know $2 [tacos] still exist.
