With a full dining room and patio, {Gwen} in [West Hollywood] has risen to the top of [L.A.¡¯s] hottest restaurants in [2016]. The interior is stunning, and is thanks to a dream realized by Chef [Curtis Stone] (of Maude) and Luke Stone. {Gwen} is named after their grandmother, who lived outside of a farm outside of Melbourne. This is where they were first exposed to livestock and food which led Curtis to become one of the best chef¡¯s in the world. At {Gwen}, dinner is more than just dinner. It¡¯s an experience. Surrounded by raw meat hanging in rooms, {Gwen} is a toast to the past. But, the restaurant offers more than just meat. Salads, and great sides go along with the delicious food.
