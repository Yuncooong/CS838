For all the development reigning down on [Highland Park] right now, the northeast neighborhood still lacked that big signature restaurant you could force someone to drive across town for - but they just got one in {Cafe Birdie}. This is the kind of upscale, but laid-back restaurant that fits perfectly in the area. The service of {Cafe Birdie} is excellent, the food is great (get the pork cheek ragu), and there's a secret detached bar in the back for more revelry afterwards in {Cafe Birdie}.
