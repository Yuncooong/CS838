{Urasawa} in Beverly Hills offers one of the most exclusive Japanese dining experiences in California. The tiny establishment, [which seats about] 10 people at a time, has no menu; rather diners are presented 29 courses of owner and Chef [Hiroyuki Urasawa's] triumphant Kaizeki preparations. The formal meal presents a succession of small and meticulous dishes, each carefully crafted to accentuate the natural flavors of seasonal ingredients, many of which have been flown in from Japan earlier in the day. Chef [Urasawaâ€™s] attention to detail stretches beyond the plate, with 300-year old antique tableware and an exclusively French wine list. It is the dishes where his craft truly shines however. Diners at {Urasawa} are treated to cuisine prepared with a gentle hand, presented exquisitely, and of a quality so unrivaled, it threatens to ensure that after a four-hour dinner at {Urasawa}, no meal will seem the same.
