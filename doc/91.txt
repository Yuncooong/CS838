Chef [David Schlosser] is presenting a singular vision at {Shibumi}, and if you get on his wavelength, this place can seem like entering an alternate dimension. While working in Japan, Schlosser realized that America's understanding of Japanese cuisine is limited by our obsession with sushi, and there is a whole other world of dining that hasn't yet made the leap across the Pacific. {Shibumi} is his effort to right that situation, in a dark and strange little restaurant on Hill Street downtown.

If there's a defining element to Schlosser's cooking, and {Shibumi} in general, it is simplicity. The chef wants you to taste the ingredients ¡ª really taste them ¡ª so much so that eating here can be like discovering the elemental truth of foods you thought you knew well. There's a focus on texture rarely seen in Western cooking, which can be revelatory or disconcerting, depending on the dish and on your personal tolerance for viscosity. Cold seafood dishes are designed to highlight the fish above all else, but Schlosser adds elements that reinforce the silkiness and freshness of a Japanese sea bream, for instance, by contrasting it with the barely-there crunch of a ginger bud, its delicate floral flavor shimmering at the edge of your consciousness.

[Grilled pork] and beef are presented so simply but are of such high quality and have been cooked so well that you're forced to ponder the elemental wonder of deeply flavored flesh and fat, its animal funk and tang. I did not fork over the $52 for four ounces of Wagyu rib cap, but I did not need to. The $28 California strip, served with bracing but creamy fresh wasabi, offered the best bites of beef I've had in months, maybe years.

{Shibumi} is the result of one chef's years-long quest come to fruition, a singular focus on bringing something precious carefully across an ocean and laying it in front of us on polished vintage cypress. 815 S. Hill St., downtown. (213) 265-7923, shibumidtla.com. ¡ªB.R.
