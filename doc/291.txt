Dining at the {Monsoon Café} is a relaxing, spiritual experience provided by a unique atmosphere and fresh food. Even before diners walk through the door they are hypnotized by a pair of soothing yet intriguing eyes that adorn the front of the restaurant. The restaurant itself looks like a [two story Eastern] temple high ceilings and dazzling lighting fixtures, with lots of gold trim adorning [columns and walls alike]. There is plenty of seating in an open courtyard, with plenty of shade for even the sunniest days. Night is an exciting time at the {Monsoon Café}, with Salsa lessons and performances on Wednesdays and Saturdays and DJ battles on Friday nights.
