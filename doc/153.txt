{La Dolce Vita} opened its' doors in Beverly Hills in 1966. The biggest celebrities in the world lived only moments away, and {La Dolce Vita} literally became their second home for decades to come. Regulars included the Sinatras, the Reagans, the Pecks, the Douglases, and the Bloomingdales. It hosted every sitting US President since the Kennedy administration, and was [known] as a haven [for] titans of industry and finance. Deals were made with a handshake, and everyone was certain to arrive on Thursdays for Osso Bucco. Now, {La Dolce Vita} moves to the future, following a seven month 'facelift,' during which the restaurant was restored to its' original pristine condition, reprieving the original menu, recipes, and decor. {La Dolce Vita} arrives once again as a popular dining and entertainment destination, now home to young Hollywood and those seeking the traditional cuisine of Italy.
