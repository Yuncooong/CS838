{Howlin Ray's}, the food [truck¨Cturned¨Cbrick-and-mortar], is a bona fide food phenomenon. The line begins at least 30 minutes before the doors open, and grows steadily over the day, snaking around Chinatown's Far East Plaza to sometimes ridiculous lengths. Why? Even compared with the hot-chicken stalwarts of [Nashville], {Howlin Ray's} is turning out some serious yardbird: The devilishly spicy skin ¡ª we recommend the "hot" spice level ¡ª is crunchy and well-seasoned, while the meat inside remains exceptionally moist. In traditional style, each piece of chicken is accompanied by a few thick-cut pickles and a slice of white bread to soak up the spicy juices. You can add a basket of "hot fries" ¡ª crinkle-cut fries tossed in spices ¡ª or a rotating market side, such as a tangy cucumber and dill salad. Even better might be the two-fisted fried chicken sandwich, constructed with coleslaw, pickles and tangy "comeback sauce" on a toasted bun.

There's some truth to the idea that [hot chicken] is just a trend right now, and that's why {Howlin Ray's} is so very popular, but there's something else at play here: Every day, chef-owner Johnny Ray Zone is there, plating every single piece of chicken, making sure it comes out correct. You can taste that kind of dedication, and it tastes very good. {Howlin Ray's}, 727 N. Broadway, #128, Chinatown. howlinrays.com. ¡ªG.S. & B.R.
