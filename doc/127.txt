QUICK PITCH Along with nearby sister restaurant {Gjusta}, chef Travis Lett’s Venice vortex for scruffy beards and sexy grilling (pizza, prawns, peppers) is the Southern California restaurant({Gjelina} that New York food snobs most outwardly crush hard on. The lunchtime crowd includes workers from [nearby] Google and SnapChat; by night, the demo shifts toward Tinderati nibbling on radicchio. Beyonce and Jay-Z have been known to make the brunch scene.
INSIDE DISH The no-substitutions policy is [strictly enforced] – celebrities included. When she was eight-months-pregnant Victoria Beckham was denied an unadorned smoked trout salad as an aghast dining companion Gordon Ramsay looked on.
