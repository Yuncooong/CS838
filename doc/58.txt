Nashville [hot chicken] food truck turned LA food cult {Howlin Ray¡¯s} brick and mortar is open in Chinatown¡¯s Far East Plaza and it¡¯s an all-out blockbuster. But you¡¯ve been warned: open only from 11pm-4pm daily, you¡¯ll be greeted with an hour-long wait no matter when you go. [That said], we would wait two. Everything about this place works, and despite the wait, it¡¯s exceptionally well-run. As for the chicken? Incredible. Order it dark or white (or in a sandwich), pick your heat level, and enter into fried chicken nirvana at {Howlin Ray¡¯s}.
