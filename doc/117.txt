Filipino cuisine was the “it” cuisine of the year, and brothers Chase and Chad Valencia strode confidently into the wave with their pop-up {Lasa}. The Valencia brothers note that Filipino food has been [hidden] away in the kitchens of grandmothers for too long, and {Lasa} (housed at chef Alvin Cailan’s restaurant incubator Unit 120) is their attempt to spotlight the cuisine. Chef Chad happily serves traditional dishes like pancit (which he modernize with the addition of a homemade patis, and a heavy serving of butter), or Binatog Popcorn, made with coconut oil and toasted coconut chips (the sort of luxurious snack you would want to eat on the beach in Palawan). A [prix-fixe] menu is available if you can’t decide which treat to choose.

{Lasa} is located at 727 N Broadway #120 in Chinatown. (213) 443-6163
