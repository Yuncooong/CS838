{Crossings} restaurant is located in the beautiful historic Edwards and Faw building on Mission St. in South Pasadena, originally built in 1908. {Crossings} utilized the beautiful brick and mortar [structure] to inspire a classic American restaurant space. The downstairs dining room encompasses a fully open kitchen and 14 foot ceilings. A patio under a 100 year old oak sits right next to the Metro Gold Line, providing a truly urban space not often found in LA. A wine loft sits [between the first] and second floors, offering a wide variety of choices. Two bars, one on each floor, offer hand crafted cocktails as well as barrel aged selections made in house by our bartenders.
