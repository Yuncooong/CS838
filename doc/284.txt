Theme park dining usually means overpriced, tasteless food in small portions. However, the {Napa Rose} located in Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel and Spa delivers park goers a sophisticated, delicious meal. Views of Disney’s California Adventure park can be seen through the glass windows, but no park ticket is necessary to dine here. Head chef [Andrew Sutton] changes the menu seasonally, providing fresh ingredients in his dishes. For appetizers, the Starter to [Share consists of] Large Seared Shrimp in Garlic Sauce, Pork Spare Ribs with Soy Glaze, and Lemongrass Chicken Skewers. To keep the food at the right temperature, a hot beach stone sits in the middle, allowing patrons to warm their food as they like. Main entrée favorites include Colorado Rack of Lamb Roasted with Autumn Herbs, served with Roasted Young Root Vegetables and Sangiovese Lamb Jus. The real highlight of {Napa Rose} is its Chef’s Counter, a four -course prix-fixe menu hand selected by Chef Andrew for the table. The fine dining but relaxed atmosphere makes {Napa Rose} family friendly, but romantic enough for date nights.
