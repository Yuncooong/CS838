QUICK PITCH Like Bestia, {Officine Brera} this newcomer has an industrial lofty-chic interior in downtown L.A.’s Arts District and Italian [countryside] cuisine leaning hard on the handmade pastas and the wood-grilled oven. But {Officine Brera} is relatively less loud and, at least for the moment, quite a bit easier to book a reservation. The chicken thigh salad with butter lettuce and candied oranges in {Officine Brera} is an understated winner.
INSIDE DISH Beware the [traffic-diverting] closure of the historic Sixth Street Bridge (a frequent shooting location, from Grease to The Amazing Race) a gnocchi’s toss away. Its demolition, begun in February, will last through the fall.
