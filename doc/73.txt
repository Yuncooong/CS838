{Moruno}, at The Original Farmers Market, and {Bar Moruno}, at Grand Central Market, brings a unique style of upscale casual dining to two of [Los Angeles¡¯] historic sites. At the Original Farmers Market, {Moruno} features a [ground-floor] dining room and counter which surround the wood-fueled grill and kitchen, while there is also an upstairs patio and vermouth bar. The [southern Spanish] inspired menu is supported by a wine list focusing on Spain and the South of France. And, if you are wondering what a {Moruno} is, it is a kebab cooked over live coals and marinated in spices which highlight both Moorish and North African culinary influences. Sherry features prominently on both menus, as well as the proprietary Vermouth ¡®Vermina¡¯ which is served on tap.
