We didn¡¯t know we needed a [focaccia-by-the-slice] spot in our lunch rotation, but {Di Alba} in the Arts District has shown us what we've been missing. This order at the counter place inside a Shinola store has five or so focaccias on the menu, as well as a few salads and vegetables to go with what are essentially thick slices of pizza. [Toppings] range from prosciutto and fior di latte to brussels sprouts, but our favorite is the breakfast focaccia with smoked salmon, hard boiled eggs, and pickled onion. Space of {Di Alba} is small, with only a handful of tables, so it's the kind of place where you can stop in and pick up lunch to go, or have a quick solo time out between meetings
