{Silver Lake} just got a [brand new] casual Chinese spot and it is absolutely excellent. There¡¯s nothing special about the setup here - you order [at the register], take a number, and wait for the food to come out. But this is exactly the kind of place every neighborhood in [LA] should have, but somehow doesn¡¯t. And that¡¯s what makes {Fat Dragon} special. The spicy wontons, dragon fried rice, and the eggplant are all musts.
