{Tsubaki} quietly opened in the former Kush space in Echo Park, and we’ll tell you right now - this place is big time. There’s plenty of good izakaya in [LA], but {Tsubaki} already feels a grade above the rest. From [the trout] ceviche to the chicken meatballs to the curry soba noodles, this menu is absolutely stacked and surprisingly affordable as well. Our move is to sit at the bar and strike up a conversation with the fantastic staff who will no doubt tell you about personal trips to Japan and proceed to get you very drunk on {shochu}. {Tsubaki} might be pretty new, but our money’s on it being around for a very long time.
