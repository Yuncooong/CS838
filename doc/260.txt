{Opaque} in Santa Monica offers diners a one of a [kind culinary] experience. One that is proposed to enhance the senses of taste, smell, touch, and hearing by abandoning one that we often take for granted, {Opaque} is “Dining in the Dark”. The straightforward menu offers diners the entrée choice of Filet Mignon, Roasted Herb Chicken Breast, Seared Atlantic Salmon, or [Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto] Rigatoni. Dessert is either a Mango Panna Cotta or Warm Chocolate Lava Cake. Blind servers aid guests with tips on how to approach dining free of sight, and a portion of the bill goes towards blindness research. For a one of a kind dining experience not soon forgotten, visit {Opaque}.
