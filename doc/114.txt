{Kato}’s storefront might strike you as nearly blank and the interior's decor as subdued—if not downright minimal—but that's because chef Jonathan Yao (an Alma alum) is busy packing his dishes with maximum punch. Each plate of the seven-course tasting menu is brightly flavored and immaculately presented. A dish of porridge is topped with uni to give it the right balance of saltiness, while Dungeness crab and scallion compliment the pairing. A black briquette is in fact a squid ink-colored bun filled with pork belly. For dessert in {Kato}, a dollop of thick, tart buttermilk pudding plays against the texture of rose-flavored ice shavings that melt instantly in your mouth. Book a table soon, because this gem won't stay hidden for long.
{Kato} is located at 11925 Santa Monica Boulevard in West L.A. (424) 535-3041
