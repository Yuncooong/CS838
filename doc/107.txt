[Silver Lake’s] new locals' hangout has arrived. {Wolfdown} is a more formal restaurant from the people behind neighborhood spot Forage - and by more formal we mostly mean you don't order at the counter here. The [old bungalow] space on Rowena is beautiful, and has a back patio you’ll be spending half your summer nights on. The {Wolfdown} menu is definitely eclectic - patatas bravas and Korean fried chicken are both present - but the {Wolfdown} food itself is tasty and unfussy.
