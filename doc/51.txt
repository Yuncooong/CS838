When all-day modern diner {Ledlow} decided to [cut itself] in half and turn into two separate restaurants, we were kind of bummed But then we actually ate at the new half, a mostly-vegetarian spot called {P.Y.T.}, and now we¡¯re happy again. [The food] is interesting, the service is so friendly you¡¯ll wonder if they¡¯re being condescending (they¡¯re not), and even the cocktails have vegetables in them. Don¡¯t miss the [ricotta cavatelli] with mushroom dashi, nori, pecorino, and yogurt. It's weird. But also excellent.
