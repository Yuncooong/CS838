Marcel Vigneron envisions {Wolf} as the culinary embodiment of Los Angeles: multi-cultural, farm-to-table, and photogenic. This is not to say, of course, that Wolf is without substance. Order the crispy potatoes for an ostensibly simple dish whose flavor will wow. The potatoes are fried and paired with a chive aioli that adds complexity and a sharp kick. The beef cheeks are [another standout] of the dinner menu. The turmeric sauce works to heighten the meatâ€™s tender juiciness, [while] the Jerusalem artichokes happily play a supporting role. In true L.A. fashion, {Wolf} also offers a brunch menu. Vigneron pulls an inventive and delicious twist on a breakfast staple with his Chai French Toast.
{Wolf} is located at 7661 Melrose Avenue in the Sneaker District. (323) 424-7735
