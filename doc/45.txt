There are parts of LA that seem to get all the [good restaurants] and parts that don¡¯t. {La Brea} and {Wilshire} is definitely the latter. Plagued with [never-ending] subway construction, most LA drivers have detoured around the area for months now, but with the arrival of {Commerson}, it¡¯s time to start heading back. The [seafood-based restaurant] has found the perfect balance between being an upscale destination restaurant and a place you can walk into for a quick bite on a Tuesday. The scallop dish and the poke appetizer are our current favorites, but we haven¡¯t eaten anything that¡¯s disappointed.
