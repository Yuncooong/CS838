QUICK PITCH Chef Nick {Erven}, who drew a cult following with his short-lived if much-buzzed-about foodie [sensation] Saint Martha in Koreatown, blows out that restaurantâ€™s brief experiment in veganism into the m.o. of this meatless mecca in Santa Monica. Inventive cross-culturalism finds the kitchen sending out seaweed "Doritos," Korean "gnocchi" and heart of palm tamales with beet mole and a [lime-horseradish] gremolata. The chocolate donut with potato chips of {Erven} is a gut bomb for dessert.
INSIDE DISH Fittingly, the address was previously home for 24 years to pioneering vegan spot Real Food Daily, which closed in April.
