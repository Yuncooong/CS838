Los Angeles is already a mecca for Japanese food. A casual stroll down Sawtelle, or through the strip malls of Little Tokyo, will reveal shop after shop peddling everything from seafood okonomiyaki, to zasai pickles, to late-night izakaya fare. Admist this (and after half a year of delays), enter {Shibumi}. Any presumptions made by {Shibumi’s} location inside a parking garage are quickly dispelled after stepping inside. The 30-foot long, 400 year-old Cypress trunk countertop serves as the dining room’s centerpiece. Behind it, chef David Schlosser (who has [studied] in the kitchens of L’Arpege, Urasawa, Kikunoi Honten, and Aureole, among others) works with grace and precision to create a menu taking Japanese traditions and inserting his own Western twist. The corn soup is a highlight. The abalone dish is a rare treat and the addition of miso gives it sweetness. Be sure to finish with an order of the black sesame ice cream topped with puffed rice. It is hard to leave {Shibumi} [without] thinking Schlosser has created a singular experience in L.A.
{Shibumi} is located at 815 S. Hill Street in Downtown Los Angeles. (213) 265-7923
