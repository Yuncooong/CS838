Guests are encouraged to [begin] the experience in the [sleek] and lush BG Lounge upstairs, accessed by elevator. Here one can meet for more privacy, enjoy early or late bites paired with one of Mixologist Perbellini’s original cocktails – the Costa Amalfitana or Pearbellini, or his interpretation of historic and contemporary classics like the Nerano Negroni Blanco, Aperol Spritz, Boulevardier and La Floridita Daiquiri. The lounge in {Nerano} doubles as a private event space and includes a dedicated kitchen.
