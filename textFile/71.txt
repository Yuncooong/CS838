I've had three meals here. The first (a chicken wrap) was so-so, the other two (salads) were not good.  The beef was so tough that I couldn't eat it, and when eating the chicken, I kept biting into chunks of fat, skin & gristle-GROSS- so I kept spitting it out in my napkin. I sent an email over their website to complain about both of these entrees. The owner responded that they cook and serve the chicken WITH skins, saying it makes the it juicier. Um ok but it's also disgusting. He offered me a refund and I agreed (given that I'd had TWO bad meals) but then they never responded after that.  

Not only that but when I paid for my meal, the cashier asked if I wanted to buy a drink.  I had a water bottle with me, plus I never drink big cold beverages with meals (I only sip on water), so I said no thanks.  Then she said I really should buy one of their house-made lemonade drinks and tried to make it seem as though there were something wrong with ME for declining one. WTF??
