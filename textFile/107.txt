Kali Restaurant
Came back again and found they have changed several items during lunch time. We ordered Ridgeback Prawns, Charred Avocado, Citrus and Burrata, Chicken Breast and Meringue Gelato. The prawns were served raw and cut up into pieces, I thought the dish was ok but my husband didn't enjoy it. The avocado was great, we were so happy that we tried it. The citrus and burrata was a new item on the menu, this one was also amazing. Unfortunately the chicken dish wasn't as good as the one we had last time but the meringue gelato was still tasty as I'd expected. Hope the restaurant could update the online menu regularly! We'd love to be back and try more dishes!
