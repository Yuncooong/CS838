7th Street Cafe
Went for the jugular on my very first visit...both of my items came from the special menu and hey didn't disappoint 
Never had either items (Mac & Patty or the Jerk Balls) art any other cafe so they are definitely trendsetters in that regard.
Since it was opening day I got to spin the wheel to determine how much my meal would cost me so walking out with a craving quenched...taste buds delighted ALL for under $5...now that's a winner
