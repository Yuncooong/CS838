The Little Sweet Place
The non-cheese cake type panna cottas are quite light and refreshing. A couple of the cheese cakes I tried were generally good but not my cup of tea. The group's favorite seemed to be the chocolate salted caramel and the coffee caramel. The raspberry is a plain panna cotta with a raspberry liquid on top. The cheese cakes each has a base crust the is made of cashew and almond.
