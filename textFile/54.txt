my two Â¢ents
I love this place!  I live in the neighborhood and went there with an out of town visitor a few years ago.  Now I take everyone there!

Sweet potato crumble = amazing!
the quinoa mac and cheese = so good!
Other highlights; turkey meatloaf sandwich, shrimp and grits, black eyed pea hummus

It gets busy and it's small, non peak times are the best.
