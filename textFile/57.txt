Pine & Crane
I've tried to review this place several times, my peasant vocabulary won't do it justice but dammit I'm going to try. This place is heaven on earth - hands down favorite place to go for warm and delicious comfort food without feeling like you want to die afterward (that is the rarest pokemon of them all). 

Let's start with the standard leish order:
- almost everything from the cold counter, in order of favorites of my children - the bean curd omg most delicious light pickled fresh chewy tofu (it holds up to the taste and is perfect for sharing) - they almost always run out if you come late in the day, if its there GET IT!!
- woodear salad: fresh light not too chewy (sometimes woodear can get rough and kind of weird to bite through, this woodear is always the perfect texture) and the pockets really hold the flavoring
- seaweed salad: its the perfect amount of marinaded but not slimy/soggy - very delicious
(all of these things are the perfect compliment to a heavier meal - bites of the pickled fresh veggies between beef roll bites cut through the oil with a really nice light flavor that mind hacks you into thinking you're healthy)
