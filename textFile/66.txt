I remember I once went to {Sushi Kingz} cause it was the only open place late at night. [The place] was insanely cramped and there were literally homeless people walking out of the basement past us to get outside the restaurant. Since the place was tiny, drugged out homeless people walking next to you was not helping out the ugly interior of the restaurant.
The bathroom was fucking pitch black even with the light on and I saw fresh blood on the floor. Felt like I was in a horror movie for a moment there.
The food at {Sushi Kingz} was complete shit and was one of the very rare times where I did not tip. The [food] took about 20 minutes to prep up and when it was served, they gave us the wrong items. I wasn¡¯t surprised since the ¡°kitchen¡± is next to the tables and the entire room was pretty dark so I¡¯d imagine it was tough for the ¡°cook¡± to prepare sushi.
Place was sketchy as fuck.
