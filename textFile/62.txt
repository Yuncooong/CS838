Komodo 
Located on the corner of the crowded intersection of Pico and Robertson, I nearly missed this place on the drive by. For a place that has received a lot of reviews and hype, it doesn't really bring attention to passerbys.

There was one thing that stood out to me when I first walked in: this place is hella tiny. I could probably count three or four small tables and a stainless steel counter with probably at max 12 stools. Three is a crowd here so you will have a hard time finding seating if you're not by yourself or on a date. There wasn't a line when I went around 8 on a Saturday night, but only counter seating was available.
