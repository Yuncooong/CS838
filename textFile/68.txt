Pokémolé
Best poké spot in Ktown!!!

Yes. I've tried all of them.

While waiting for my turn to order, I was watching the worker make a poké burrito and the amount of fish and toppings she was putting in it made me think, "damn she's gonna get in trouble for using so much fish...." But she did it again with a second burrito! Needless to say I couldn't wait to order MY food. 

I decided to go with their Hwe Dup Bap bowl and sure enough I was rewarded with lots of fresh fish and a whole array of toppings. My buddy got the same and he hates cucumber, but he ate every piece of it. Haha that's how good this place is. I only wish they had cilantro. I mentioned this to the worker and she offered their habanero cilantro sauce...that shit is FIRE. Literally and figuratively. Spicy goodness. And not the fake spicy...ASIAN spicy. KOREAN spicy. It was spicy. And soooo good!
