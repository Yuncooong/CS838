Pasta Sisters
Like many people, I found out about this place because of Buzzfeed. Oh boy, I have never been so happy that I binge watch YouTube. My GF loves pasta and after the Buzzfeed Video she made it her mission to come check this place out. The restaurants is pretty small - I would say they can seat about 10 people - so be prepared to wait for a table or just get take out. My GF and I got there at around 630pm and there was a line to order but nothing crazy. There were no seats but luckily a couple left right after we ordered so we snatched 2 seats. While we waited, the restaurant started to fill up and there was a line out the door. I like the order process - choose a pasta, choose a sauce, wait for the magic to come on a plate.
