Burning Buns
I noticed the menu had enough to choose from, the options of different sauces and ingredients came together well in my burning buns classic burger, as well as the smurf burger topped with blue cheese crumble, the patty was well favored and the buns were crispy in the inside and soft on the outside. I would definitely go back and tell my friends and family about this great experience I had I met the owners and they were great.
