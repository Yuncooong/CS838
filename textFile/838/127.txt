Napoleon and Josephine
Authentic French cuisine made from scratch! Don't worry about the pre-fix menu because there is something on there for everyone. I found this place because of yelp and it's amazing reviews. I had friends in town from Denver visiting and wanted to pick a place with amazing food and drinks. We got everything we needed and more. From apps to dessert everything was sooooo good! Definitely adding this on my "when friends visit LA places to go list!"
