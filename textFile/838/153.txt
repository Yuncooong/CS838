Han Bat Sul Lung Tang
So the parking is in the back a little hidden but luckily when we got there, it was still pretty empty  (10:30am). My friends and I got seated basically immediately. They only serve the beef soup and this other dish but everyone is here for the soup. Since we didn't know which variation of beef to get, we all got the mixed. It had brisket, intestines, etc. It is served with pickled radish, kimchi, and rice. The soup was very stocky and rich. We put in a little salt and lots of green onions and dived in. It was so good! It went perfectly with the rice and the flavors are super comforting.
