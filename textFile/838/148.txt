Kukui Hut Caf√©
I just checked yelp for new restaurants for the first time since the winter and Kukui Hut seemed really cool so I checked it out and it WAS. I got the Pork plate w/ mac and cheese and rice and holy shit, it was amazing. The pork was strait up soft and juicy. And then little things like the crispy onions in the mac and cheese and the garnishing on the rice go a long way. Food was really well priced and the portions were generous.
