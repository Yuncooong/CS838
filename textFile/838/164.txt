Gok Jee Food
I ordered kids event to cover 350 people. Price was calculated per person, yet food came in huge tray of 5. We had hard time figure out how to serve right portion...and of course food ran out too quick. 
People appreciated the food so I believe it was tasty. And service was good and prompt.  They sent me reminder message as well. 
I will definitely use them again for other event, but will order extra portion next time to be safe.
