Jinsol Gukbap
Anytime it's cold jinsol is my favorite spot!
Their pork soup that is served with side dishes and rice noodles are the best (especially when raining)
I'm from the area in South Korea where pork soup originated so I know a good pork soup when I taste one and this place is definitely as close it it gets to what I ate in Korea.
