Leoâ€™s Tacos Truck
The service and atmosphere at these two taco trucks are quite a bit in contrast to one another. When I arrived at El Chato around midnight there were only two other people in line, and I was able to park right behind the truck and eat at the very limited counter space right there attached to the front end of the truck. This was fine. In contrast to that but also fine was a bustling atmosphere at Leo's maybe thirty minutes later. Parking was completely jammed so I parked about a quarter mile down the road and there were people everywhere with specifically five or six folks in front of me. Different, but both good and the tacos came out quick all around.
