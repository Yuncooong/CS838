Sulga Jinju Gom Tang House of Beef Soup
This place has the best gom tang in Koreatown, especially their knee cap gom tang. Their broth is denser and richer than others and it sort of reminds me of a less fatty version of tonkotsu. My favorite part of of the dish is all the tendons and cartilage that come with the meat. And their kimchi is ridiculously refreshing.
