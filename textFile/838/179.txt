Ubatuba Acai - Koreatown
This is by far the best acai I've ever had. Idk why it took me so long to come here. The restaurant is pretty nondescript, & the menu is simple, but when the food is so good, I really appreciate the simplicity.There are plenty of different sizing options, depending on if you want to share & how much. The prices might seem a little higher than average, but the ingredients are so pure, I think it's warranted. The topping selections are great, with some of my favorites being condensed milk & honey. They also have free tea! You really can't beat that
