Wow! Let me start off by how much I was blown away with the service. From our waiter to the chef who made me their special sauce for my yummy garlic fries! Our waiter was so friendly and made you feel right at home. The whole ambiance of the place was so warm, I loved it! Next the food! The best skirt steak I have ever consumed in my life. So juicy and tender and cooked perfectly. The garlic fries were out of this world filled with so much garlic. The empanadas you could tell were made fresh. The only thing I didnt like about this place was that I didnt come here sooner. If you are looking for a amazing Argentinian Steakhouse in service and fod quality, this is a must!
