TBLA Catering & Cafe
Asked for a catered lunch, we chose the Memphis Style Baby Back Ribs menu.Ribs were UH-MAZING, they literally fell off the bone in the best way possible. Everybody who enjoyed were very impressed with the quality of the ribs.We got the Cobb salad and Chicken Mango Salad; both were good, fresh and healthy portions. Mac and cheese was delicious (if I had to nit-pick I would say I prefer my noodles al-dente but seasoning and everything else was great), bread was lightly toasted and well buttered.Pricing was reasonable, especially for the quality of the food.
