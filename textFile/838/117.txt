The dishes mainly embody rice bowls with varying ingredients and steamed buns. Their chicken longanisa, to that end is a sweet cured ground chicken on top of garlic rice and toped with a perfectly fried sunnyside side egg, scallions, and red radish, was amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked and loved the flavor that it yielded.
