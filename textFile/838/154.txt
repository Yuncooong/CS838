Leoâ€™s Tacos Truck
Cheap and mouth watering tacos! This is the one of the best things I had on my trip to LA this time. I had Leo's two years ago and I can't believe the prices are still relatively the same. It's $1.25 per taco, you can't beat that price! If you stop by at night be prepared to be greeted with a long line. Luckily, I visited on a chilly night for LA locals and there weren't that many other patrons waiting in line. I opted for two cabezas and one al pastor tacos. Next to the register, you will see a condiment stand next to the truck which you can add various toppings to your liking. Some toppings include onions, cilantro and green or red salsa.
