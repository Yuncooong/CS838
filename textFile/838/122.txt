Tofu and Noodles
the food here is really good! We got the stone pot bibimbap and a tofu soup. Both came with plenty of food - we shared amongst 3 people. The bibimbap was so healthy and delicious. The veggies were seasoned well and the rice was cooked perfectly. The tofu soup was really flavorful too- a bit salty but I'm sure it's because you eat it with rice. The banchan (side dishes) they had were refillable and they were also plenty delicious. There were the traditional kimchi, bean sprouts, seasoned cucumber, etc.
