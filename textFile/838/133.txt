Sulga Jinju Gom Tang House of Beef Soup
This is one of those hidden gems where they take an unusual ingredient and turn it into a healthy and delectable soup and I am talking about the knee cap soup.  They start off by serving you a host of Korean (kimchi) appetizers then they bring out the broth.  Server then cuts up the pre cooked boiled beef knee tendons and add them into the piping hot broth.  A dipping sauce and organic sea salt is on hand to adjust flavor according to personal preference.  A must try.  Service is par excellence and the place us neat and intimate.
