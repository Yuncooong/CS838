White Boy Tacos
These tacos are BOMB.COM! Ben was so nice, and informed us right away what tacos were available for the rest of the night.  My girlfriend and I came here after a late night out in DTLA and were craving some tacos! Just FYI, these tacos are nontraditional and offer a white-boy twist! I ordered the Foghorn chicken tacos (AMAZING 10/10 RECOMMEND) and the Little Foot Tacos (not as great as Foghorn but still very satisfying).
