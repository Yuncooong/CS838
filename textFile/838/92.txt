Palm Grove Ethiopian Restaurant
You should try.I decided to be adventurous and try something out of the Italian, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Southwestern everyday fare, why not Ethiopian Food?! What a great idea, so glad I did food was excellent, service was attentive. I'm happy I came here on my birthday. I really liked the stewed beef dish it was slightly spicy. My friend really liked house cider/wine. They also had baklava but I didn't try it.
