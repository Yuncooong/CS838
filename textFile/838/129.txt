Napoleon and Josephine
This place is unlike any restaurant I have been to in LA.  The ambience makes you feel like you have been transported to a small bistro in France. The food and wine is all very delicious, and I would recommend splurging the $5 to get the antipasti (you will get a large variety and quantity for the extra money).  The menu is not extensive but there was enough variety for the entrees and desserts for everyone to find something they like (unless you are extremely picky).  Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours at the meal as the service moved at a leisurely pace. It was very crowded on a Saturday night and they were turning away walk-ins, so I would recommend making a reservation.
