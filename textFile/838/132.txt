White Boy Tacos
Decided to come try this taco stand while I was in DTLA and im so happy that we came here! The owner was super friendly and the taco selection was really interesting. We wanted to get 3 tacos but we didnt know what to get other than the beef or chicken so he said hell make something up for us and all 3 were BOMBB LOL such interesting mixture of toppings but they all work well together
