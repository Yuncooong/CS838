The food, although good, was not mindblowing. We ordered the lamb, ribeye cap, the meat sampler that came with skirt steak, sausage, and ribs, as well as french fries and empanadas. The chicken empanada was my favorite to the beef and vegetable. The lamb was the best cut of the night, flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare. Everything else was good, but very rustic: not a bad thing in itself, but somewhat incongruous with the atmosphere of the place.
