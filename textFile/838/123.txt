Tofu and Noodles
It was a cold night and we were tired from a long day at Universal Studios. So we decided to use Yelp to locate a restaurant that was serving soup based dishes. We ended up at this restaurant since we wanted to explore K-Town LA. Upon entering we were promptly greeted and seated. The staff was friendly and helpful in deciding what items are popular and to familiarize us with the menu.
