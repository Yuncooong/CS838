Kukui Hut Caf√©
This place is pretty small. Cashier would yell orders back to the kitchen in between watching HGTV on the mounted TV, which I found endearing, but some may find starling. My order included 2 large scoops of white rice, mac n cheese enhanced by meaty run off juices, and the star of the show: kalbi short ribs. Each rib was deliciously juicy and satisfying. Not too much fat and a good amount of meat for one meal. I also tried the Kahlua pork, which was a bit salty and could use more sauce,  but I still enjoyed it.The staff was friendly, and there are enough appealing menu options that I would go back to try again.
