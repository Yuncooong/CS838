Mex Per√∫ Gipsy
This is a tiny restaurant where you will need to street park but its delicious. Food is cooked right in front of you.  Service is friendly.  My friend wanted fried plantains and asked if they had them.  They just cooked it for us on the spot.  I don't even know if it was their menu. We both had the lomo saltado which is $15. Its a big portion size for one person.  Love the fresh meat and french fries in it!! Definitely want to come back to try other things on their menu.
