Squarefritz
My husband brought home some empanadas from Squarefritz and they were so good! I've had it bookmarked for awhile now but we hadn't made it it over there. I had the hearts of palm empanada. It was delicious-the outside was so crispy and not overly greasy, and the inside was full of hearts of palm and cheese which, it transpires, is a very tasty combination. My husband also really liked his meat empanadas.
