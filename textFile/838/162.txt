Jinsol Gukbap
Jinsol Gukbap serves delicious Busan style pork soup. The menu is decently clear, although I had to inquire with a waiter the difference between the "Pork soup w/ Rice" @ $9.95 vs the "Set menu with pork slice" @ $11.95. Mainly, the pork soup with rice comes in a single stone pot bowl of soup and pork slices already in it, and a bowl of rice. The Set menu comes with a separate boiling plate of thicker, juicier pork slices, another stone pot with just soup, a bowl of rice, and a side of noodles to put in the soup. That being said, I ordered the set menu as it looked much more appealing (esp with that fatty pork belly).
