Gok Jee Food
We were looking for a catering company for my moms birthday and decided to go with this place due to great reviews. Everyone over here is really nice. We ordered a couple of different items off the menu that came out to a little more than we expected. This place isn't the cheapest. The food seemed fresh and tasted good. They had our order ready the next day, and waited after closing hours for us.The only downside was that the galbi jjim we ordered seemed over priced compared to what we got. It would have been better if they packaged it in a smaller tub instead of throwing unnecessary bones in there to make it look full. Since customer service was good, they saved a star from 3 to 4.
