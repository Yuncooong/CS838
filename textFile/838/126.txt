Powerplant Superfood Cafe
We ordered the BBQ cauliflower salad subbing the beans for the tostada slaw. When it came out in this gigantic bowl my eyes literally lit up to see so much lettuce topped with so much organized color haha ... literally an edible rainbow. I just wish that it came with more cauliflower, especially since it's a cauliflower salad and theor bbq cauliflower is infamous in my book.
