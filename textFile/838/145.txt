Bronzed Aussie
I usually get the ground beef or the curry chicken. Both are excellent! The flakiness of the pies are great and I think the flavors are good as well. I also love that they have frozen pies to go!!!! Just put them in the oven for 30 minutes and you have dinner! Unfortunately on my last trip to LA, I left them in my parents' freezer!  Lucky for them. They also have a tofu curry which my husband gets which is good as well.
