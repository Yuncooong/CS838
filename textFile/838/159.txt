Deli-cious Deli & Catering
The chicken pesto panini is a favorite. Actually that's the only one i get from this place. Maybe ill try the other ones eventually but they seemed to make this correctly, according to how i wanted it done. Also the staff are very friendly and everything is reasonably priced :)
