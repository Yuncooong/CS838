I've never had Brazilian empanadas so this place definitely intrigued me. Parking can be pretty difficult in the plaza but I guess that goes for anywhere in ktown and LA for that matter. The restaurant is cozy and the place is still relatively new looking. I ordered the especial empanada cause it seemed like the must-order of this restaurant.
The salsa that comes with the empanada is flavorful and reminds me of a pico de gallo. The empanada is a good size but the filling was a bit sparse. The especial comes with ground beef cheese ham and a boiled egg (which was cooked very well!) but the ratio of the fried wrapper vs the filling was just not good to me. Lots of fried dough, not enough meat. I guess most empanadas I have tried in the past have a lot of filling in the center which is why I didn't like the lack of filling in these empanadas. Definitely good to give it a try as the prices are really fair and there's many other combinations to try as well.
