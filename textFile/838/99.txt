Mex Per√∫ Gipsy
Had the famous Loma Saltado for lunch today.  Lots of tender strips of beef with made-to-order french fries, tomato, cilantro, and purple onion stir-fried together on high heat with a to-die for gravy produced from all that fresh ingredient, a perfect pair with the steam rice!!  This dish was absolutely savory and flavorful!
