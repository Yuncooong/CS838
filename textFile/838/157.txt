Deli-cious Deli & Catering
t had been a while since my last visit to Deli-cious. I used to be in the area and stop by for a sandwich all the time, but then my schedule changed and I hadn't had a chance to enjoy one of their yummy grilled veggie paninis in quite a bit.I was very pleased to go there the other day and see that their food is still as mouth watering as always! My favorite thing about Deli-cious is that they only use the best ingredients. And it truly shows in the flavor of their sandwiches. They are - as the name says - DELICIOUS! I can't stress that enough.
