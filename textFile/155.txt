Leoâ€™s Tacos Truck
The tacos here are pretty filling, however if you come hungry I would recommend getting at least 5. This was my first time trying cabeza and it was delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful. I previously tried the al pastor and I knew they wouldn't disappoint. The al pastor is grilled in front of the food truck and you can see the staff slicing the meat off the spit and with one quick swoop cut a small piece of pineapple richoteting it into your taco. The al pastor has a pineapple in it which adds a nice tangy taste into your taco. On my previous visit I had the steak and lengua tacos. Those were also excellent but I think so far my favorite is the cabeza.
