Came here for a quick lunch during the work week. What a great find! Taiwanese fusion food - I tried the pork belly and ribs rice bowl and the turnip cake fries. Both were excellent. The fries had the perfect dusting of salt and pepper and the dipping sauce was over-the-top garlicky delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the bowl was hearty and filling. I wish they included more veggies - they do have a salad but I personally find straight salads to be pretty boring.
