Yes, we all know that {Pasadena} is no longer a complete and utter dining black hole, but it¡¯s still a pretty big deal every time a decent new spot opens. [The modern] and kind of fancy Mexican restaurant {Maestro}, though, is the kind of place that any neighborhood would be excited to have. The space is small and cozy, the service friendly, and the food both interesting and delicious - if prone to arriving all at once. The duck carnitas put their [porky cousins] t co shame, andome with buttery fried bread instead of tortillas, and if you¡¯ve ever wanted to try esquites (Mexican corn) with grated crickets on top, this is the place to do it.
