my two Â¢ents
I was hesitant to try this place, because I always worry when the staff says they don't  eat the food they serve, but I looked past that. I ordered the veggie soul rolls and the gluten free Mac and cheese. Both very tasty. 

The soul roll is like an egg roll, but stuffed with greens, black eyed peas and sweet potatoes. Just like a regular egg roll the individual flavors get lost but it has a BBQ dipping sauce so it all falls together and has a very pleasing taste.
