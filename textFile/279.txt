7th Street Cafe
Very quick, cheap, and good food with nice vegetarian options. The chefs name is Alex who also works at Patina and a few other places in downtown LA. This spot is owned by the Bar Mattachine next door so if you have drinks there, you can also order food from the cafe next door. Small space available for dining but they also offer orders to go.
