my two Â¢ents
GO HERE NOW - your mouth and heart will thank you!  Best shrimp and grits I have ever tasted. The seafood gumbo was dark, spicy and delicious. The meatloaf sandwich and fried BBQ chicken were raved on by my dining partners. Peach cobbler was the best I have had in LA 

The staff are super friendly. You are warmly and loudly welcomed when you walk in and they sing if it is your first time!  The chef clearly loves what she does and her heart shows through her smile and her food.
