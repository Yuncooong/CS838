Masa of Echo Park
I wanted deep dish pizza for my birthday. My partner, an LA local, took me to Masa and, boy, did he deliver on my request! I love Masa. The piece was hot and packed with delicious ingredients on a well-flavored crust.

The atmosphere feels homey, old-style Italian family restaurant. The service was efficient and friendly. 

Had a great time and look forward to returning when I need my deep dish fix.
