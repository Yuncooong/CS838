Rodini Park
I love this place! I was having the worst day, went in here for the first time and the thoughtfulness and friendliness of the staff just brightened me up. The team members are eager to assist, asking you questions, treating you with patience and are happy to just be at work. 

I can tell the owners love their business and the people who make it successful.  Not to mention the food is delicious and the prices are right!! Can't say enough good things about Rodini Park!
