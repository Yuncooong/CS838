Yup Dduk La
Got seated on a Friday night within probably 30 minute. Service so far has been great. Ordered the yupdduk with ramyun in mild. Super excited (: will edit after the food comes out! -----edit+update-----Food was SO SO good. Portion was so huge. My friend and i ate until we were full and split the remaining into to go boxes. I will come back and bring more friends! This was an experience i enjoyed. Mild was a good level because you can still taste and get a runny nose (:
