Hae Ha Heng Thai Bistro
Great happy hour menu. I loved that I could pick different appetizers for a $1 each ($5 minimum - but very worth it). I can tell you that the cream cheese wontons were better than your average Panda Express ragoons, and that's really saying a lot for me.I ordered the drunken noodles udon style. I was feeling a bit uneasy since I like my flat rice noodles, but this dish did not disappoint. The noodles had a punch of flavor that I long for, and I'm all about udon noodles anyways.
