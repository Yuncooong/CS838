[Very nice list] ¡ª This is a great town to go out and eat in. It probably is possible to find more authentic and terrific food here than it is in [New York], and certainly more so than xenophobic [European cities] that really can only tout their own native cuisine.
My problem? I only get to town every 6 weeks. Coming for the [Columbus Day holiday] weekend ¡ª I am going to visit {Zarate} at his pop-up on [Lincoln Blvd] one night. The other night is in play. Thought about Jon and Vinny¡¯s. And a neighbor/chef friend up north here said "Go to {La Paella}, on [Burton Way] ¡ª classic!"
