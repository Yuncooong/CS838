Bowery Bungalow
This is such a cute restaurant with a beautiful intimate setting in the inside (some of the 2 people seats are too close together though) - but our group got seated outside which was more spacious. Though it was a pretty chilly night, their heat lamps worked really well to the point where I took off my jacket during dinner. The food here is just absolutely delicious. I liked every single dish we got. The following is listed from favorite to least favorite but honestly all were really good and this is a matter of ranking good food.
