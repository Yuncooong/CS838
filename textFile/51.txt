The four stars are for the pasta only.  We went here last night for dinner.  One word to the wise is that their menu on their website absolutely does not match the menu at the restaurant.  Items are not current and the prices are higher than listed.  I wish I would've known that before I went as it led to a few unexpected occurrences.  

The service is wonderful.  Just so you know, if you're ordering a dish from the pasta list, and a dish from the "entree" list, it's very likely that they will not come out at the same time, even if you mean for the pasta to be one of your entrees.  However, our server did notify us about this.
