Bolt
I've been in search of "my" coffee shop since moving to Los Angeles with my husband a year and a half ago. We're both writers, so finding the perfect work space to patronize is as/more important to us than finding a good doctor. Bolt is the first place that we both agree on and have come back to multiple times alone and together since it opened in our neighborhood. 

The coffee is delicious, hot, and smooth. The chocolate chip cookies have very literally appeared in my dreams -- thick, sweet, a little salty, crispy on the edges but chewy in the middle. Basically the epitome of everything a chocolate chip cookie should be. I appreciate that the customers are a good mix of everyone in the neighborhood, and there's parking in the back! I can't attest to the quality of the parking lot because we live right around the corner.
