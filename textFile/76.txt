Gusâ€™s World Famous Fried Chicken
So happy to have a cool spot to enjoy some seriously yummy chicken .
This place  is a nice addition to this side of town and the service is great ! 
Friendly staff and a cool atmosphere add to the amazing food they serve.
The chicken was juicy and had a nice tame spicy flavor .  In not a fan of baked beans but everything else like the okra and Mac was on point. 
In due time, they will also be serving beer so we will def be back for that .
