Howlin’ Ray’s
Came here on Saturday afternoon. Was on line for 2hrs. That wait thooo!!! SMH! But I don't mind since it's my first time and want to try it so bad. I want to know what's the hype about. I rarely eat KFC, churches chicken, and popeyes so, I have nothing to compare. I would say this is my favorite place to have fried chicken. Got the whole chicken with flavor of Country (no heat) and Mild(brush of heat) no spice at all, taste about the same. Also, got the wings flavor Medium(feel the burn) it's a bit spicy. I think I wouldn't handle the hot or the Howlin. They give you sauce on the side, it's really good! With or without sauce it's good!!! :) Didn't get to try the chicken sandwich, everyone said it's a MUST to try. Next time will get the chicken sandwich but I will not wait for more than 1hr.
