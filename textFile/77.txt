Gusâ€™s World Famous Fried Chicken
If you've had popeyes fried chicken then you've had Gus's "famous" fried chicken.

I honestly believe they straight up jacked the recipe from popeyes. There is absolutely no difference in the taste. There aren't a lot of popeyes restaurants in Los Angeles so I'm guessing a lot of the reviewers on here have never had popeyes or at least they are not familiar with the taste of the spicy cajun fried chicken.
