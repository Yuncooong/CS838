1st things first; we got to address the Elephant in the room. Places like Eater reports their own "Michelin Star" places in Los Angeles which started the rumor that Michelin no longer awards Stars to restaurants in LA. Simply misinformed. They no longer provide a guide (BTW you can buy guide books for places just not LA) 

2nd It annoyed me that Valet was 7(+tip of course) for a place where I just drop three and a half bills.
