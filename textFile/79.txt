The Carving Board
Ordered from postmates the other night and let me tell you what a treat this was .

Finally a place with stellar reviews actually lived up to the hype .

Bentley sandwich was a 10/10. Man that bacon mayo is really something special. Meat cooked perfect. 

The Memphis sandwich was a solid 8/10

Glad I found this gem. 

Thank you yeplers
