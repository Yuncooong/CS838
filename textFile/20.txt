Jun Won Restaurant
I was desperate to come here with my family after reading all these stellar reviews, and I was finally able to try it last weekend. If you are looking for genuine Korean food this is among the few places you can visit in Koreatown!! My family waited less than 20 minutes to get seated, but the real wait was on getting your food after you order.. Besides the long wait, the main plate and the side dishes were amazing!!
