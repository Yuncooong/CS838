Anyone looking for a great place for steak should look to {Chi Spacca} first. {Chi Spacca's} not a [classic-looking steakhouse]: it's small and boasts an open kitchen. The house-made [salumi] was the first such program in the city, and it's worth ordering every time. The amazing [focaccia di recco] is a [carb-lover's] dream come true. But the massive steaks, dry-aged in house and grilled to perfection, are the epitome of beef. Order a bottle of fantastic wine and you'll be ensured a legendary meal.
