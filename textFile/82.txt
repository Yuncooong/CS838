Umami Sushi Bar
Umami sushi will be my go to sushi place in ktown. The sushi pieces melt in your mouth with just the right portion of rice. The restaurant itself is very clean, modern and new and the price was affordable for the quality we got in both sushi and service. The restaurant is pretty large and not many patrons so service was quick. 

The only downside is parking. I came here on a Sunday evening around 8 pm so I was able to find free parking in a lot a block from the restaurant and my friend had to find meter parking (also free at this time).
