Lovely newer spot on La Brea. Easy street parking. We ordered about 6-8 dishes and shared it amongst our group. Food in general was solid and I especially enjoyed the hangar steak. Desserts were awesome. Manager was extremely accommodating and very personable. He ensured that it was a great dining experience. Without his stellar service, I would not have been compelled to write a review. Would try this restaurant again. :) Thank you!
