Barcito
Went on a rainy Sunday night for DineLA. 

1. We had the chicken liver mousse, palmitos salad, provoleta, asado, choripan, milanesa and churros. All very good! The menu isn't large, but I'm glad to say that they only have dishes that they do well. 
2. Service was attentive and friendly. 
3. Prices are listed at their actual price + tax. No tipping. Not even a tip line on the credit card receipt. I wholeheartedly support this concept.
