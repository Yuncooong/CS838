Pine & Crane
Pine & Crane, we meet again. It's been too long! The hype is real - this Taiwanese eatery is legit, the food is delicious and service is great (they monitor seating people and bussing tables very well). 

Things we ordered:
* Beef Roll (quite possibly the best we've ever had. We couldn't taste the oil and the ratio of sauce, beef, onion, cilantro and cucumbers were perfect!) 
* Three Cup Jidori Chicken 
* Pork Dumplings (bite-sized and comes with a tasty garlic soy sauce)
* Zha Jiang Mian
* Mapo Tofu (so fresh and so delicious)
* Sea Salt Cream Top Jasmine Green Tea with boba

Can't wait to come back!
