Corn Man
It's my second time getting corn from the Corn man, and he doesn't disappoint. For those of you wondering what an elote consists of, it's corn with butter, mayo, parmesan cheese, and the optional chile and lime. 

For $2 for a bowl (the cob is $1.50-$2 I think), you get your money's worth because he doesn't skimp on the toppings. 

The lines get pretty long, but he works pretty fast. Even though he can whip up your food in breakneck speed, I'd recommend getting there early especially if you want your elote on the cob since some customers like to buy them in bulk. If you are one of the lucky ones that are first in line, bring cash (small bills if possible), because they don't except card.
