{Gwen}, the new Hollywood restaurant from chef [Curtis Stone] and his brother, [Luke Stone], is an establishment that is striving for greatness in so many ways that it's a little head-spinning. It's a [meat importer], a butcher shop, a cocktail bar, a chophouse of sorts and a return to serious glitzy Hollywood dining the likes of which we haven't seen in decades. Unlike Stone's other restaurant, the exceedingly intimate {Maude}, {Gwen} is large and brash, with one of the most breathtaking dining rooms in the city. Where {Maude} trades in delicate luxury, Stone's rallying cry here is "primitive elegance."

The nightly prix fixe is more like an insanely over-the-top picnic than a formal meal. Courses come in great flurries of dishes, all served on little plates that spread across your table like puzzle pieces. You will see easily 20 or more dishes cross your table by the end of the evening, and many of those dishes are stunning. If you want to forgo the pricy prix fixe, you can order ¨¤ la carte at one of the two bars. One of the most memorable meals of my year was eaten at the upstairs bar, where a friend and I split a Blackmore Farms wagyu rib-eye and reveled in the glamour of the place and the beauty of that steak.

{Gwen} is a monument to one guy's glorious, meaty Hollywood dream. It's a beautiful (albeit expensive) dream, from the butcher counter to the room to the delicate vintage glassware to the food, which is cooked with talent and love. 6600 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 946-7513, gwenla.com. ¡ªB.R.
