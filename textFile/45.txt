Yuko Kitchen
Yuko has a vibe that harks back about 50 years ago, and I can envision its location on Haight Ashbury at the height of when the term Hippie came into vogue.  It's got an organic, new age feel with lush random plantings all around, chairs & tables w/ a natural worn look as though bought from a thrift store. A spherical overhead lamp that looks like a huge dandelion seed puff casts interesting spider shaped shadows on the walls.  

To add a surrealistic bit of psychedelic humour, the restroom door marked "men's" hangs about 10 feet above with a ladder to the side for access. The only thing missing was the macram√© plant hangers of old. Yu-ko is a Japanese female name so I envisioned a lady owner wearing tie-dye or batik flowing skirt & flouncy blouse, wearing Patchouli, and passing out Marijuana laden cookies.  However, no such luck.
