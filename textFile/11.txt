Mex Per√∫ Gipsy
This little hole in the wall Peruvian/Mexican cuisine is one of the best tasting, best service restaurants I have ever been to and I felt like I had personal chefs at my service. 
I couldn't believe from the outside this place could hold the revered 5 stars status, but after tonight I was a believer and blown away. 
Ordered the porterhouse steak medium rare with rice and beans as sides. Steak was seasoned very well and cooked perfect. Loved the flavor of the refried beans. Spanish rice was light and tender and had a nice flavor. 
The service was amazing and Pablo let me try three of their homemade salsas.  I liked one so much I bought a to go cup to enjoy later.
