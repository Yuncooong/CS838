Masa of Echo Park
Came here Saturday night after dodger fan fest.
Heard you should call in your order before coming in. When I called the employee told me it was busy to call it in.  All right we get there it looks packed.  We are a party of seven looks like I will be a hour wait.  The lady working the front set us up in the couch area which would be a shorter wait.  Great!
So she instructed me to place our order for the deep dish while we waited for our table.  20 minutes later we were seated.  Viola was our server
She was very accommodating for it being our first time here.  I can see from the reviews about bad service for how busy it was this night.  But Viola put that to rest she was delightful and attentive to our party.  The deep dish was great I loved all the sauce.  We also orders a thin crust and that was legit the crust was crispy.  Bruschetta was very good as well for apps.  We ended our dinner with amazing bread pudding which to me was a fluffy piece of cake it was legit.  Nice place for a date maybe not so much for big parties.  All in all cool spot great pizza.
