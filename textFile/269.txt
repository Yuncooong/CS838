{Hatfield’s} in Hollywood serves California fusion French cuisine in a New American style while using locally grown produce from local farmers markets. Owned and operated by husband-and-wife chefs [Quinn and Karen Hatfield], the couple works as a team as Quinn cooks the entrees and Karen creates the desserts and runs the restaurant. The menu consists of items a la carte, a well-known weekly market [pre-fixe menu], and a seven-course chefs’ tasting menu. The atmosphere is cozy, simple, and relaxed, perfect for a date or a nice conversation. For a fine dining experience in a striped down modern and modest setting, book a reservation at {Hatfield’s}.
