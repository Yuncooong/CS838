Son of a Gun
Ehhh... the food was pretty good but unbelievably small portions for such a pricey meal. We spent about $170 for two people; just food, no drinks. 

I specifically went cause the chicken sandwich is supposed to be great, and I'm a bit of a chicken sandwich connoisseur. It was OKAY. The sauce made me feel a little sick (Plan Check's chicken sandwich would take a giant sh*t on this one).
