The Carving Board
This place has delicious chocolate chip cookies, sandwiches, and salads! The cookies take about 15 minutes to bake, but they come out fresh, very chocolately, crisp on the outside / edges, and soft in the middle. $5 for 4 cookies, and they're perfect!

The salads are substantial and delicious. I would recommend the garden salad with added corn for an additional charge. The banh mi sandwich here is also very flavorful and a great portion size. Oh, the shoestring fries are also crispy and delicious.
