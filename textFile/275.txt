The Edmon
Stay away as far as possible! 
We went there the other night with a group for a dear friend's birthday with a reservation made a week prior. 
As we were all hungry we asked for some bread but we were advised that they don't do bread service there (strange no?) then we started by ordering some appetizers. The only semi decent appetizer was the truffle fries. The waiter spilled a drink on the table and instead of taking it back and replacing it just put the glass on table as if nothing happened. When he came back to ask for the second round and we told him that he spilled half of the drink instead of apologizing he was arguing that it wasn't half of it it was just a lit a bit. Well.. at the end he accepted and brought another one on the house. 
The glory began when we wanted to order our food. The menus has only 7 single entree options and couple shared. When the waiter came to take the order he told us they ran out of scallops and chicken ( who runs out of chicken?). And then when changed our orders and finished ordering he came back 10
Minutes later saying they had run out of short ribs too. (Amazing..  50% of the menu is gone). 
Long story short we asked for the manager and him after hiding for a while decided to show up and didn't seem too apologetic about anything but said he will do something about it
