I guess I had a big expectation going into this place because you don't see a lot of "pork soup" related of restaurants outside of LA. The food quality was, overall, average. Their steamed pork belly was, however, 5 out of 5. Very fatty meat with fall off the bone tender pork belly definitely stood up. Other menu items such as spicy pork ribs and pork meat soup was just average.
