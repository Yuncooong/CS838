I liked this place. Service is great. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  The food is amazing!  I don't like onions but their citrus salad that is a mix of blood oranges, pears and onions in white balsamic is incredible. Onions mixed with pears! What an amazing taste. Who'da thought?
