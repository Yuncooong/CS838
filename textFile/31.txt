Slurpinâ€™ Ramen Bar
One of my favorite places I have been here countless times
This is super good ramen - they have a modest menu, which leaves them the room to focus on making the ramen super super special.
Everything is super fresh, they have vegetarian options, unique and tasty appetizers, and the dessert soooooo goood - ice cream macaroons yummmmm
If you go I might be here - I go as much as I can
