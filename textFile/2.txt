Wow the spicy rice cakes are spicy. I ordered mild since I heard the regular was very spicy. NO sir, I will order extra mild next time. Sorry. I've got a long way to go in terms of ordering any spicier. I felt like my tastebuds were being burned off. It also gets spicer as you eat more and more and it gets even spicier as you sit there.
