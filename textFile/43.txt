Yuko Kitchen
Had a really great meal here. The restaurant is located just off the corner of Wilshire and Dunsmuir, just a couple of blocks east from some of L.A's best cultural institutions including the La Brea tar pits, LACMA, and the Peterson Automotive Museum. 

We came in for lunch and ordered a chicken plate, a strawberry soda, a spicy salmon bowl-ito, and a strawberry-matcha cookie. Lunch ordering is done at the counter and they will bring your food to wherever you choose to sit.
