Barcito
Barcito's $29 Dine LA menu was a steal. It is really dark and moody inside, with a large bar if you want to just come in for a drink. I don't think they have a seating hostess because we stood for about 7 minutes before being acknowledged. I would have said something but it was hard to get anyone's attention as they flew by and normally I would have left but a few friends were meeting up so I couldn't change the plans. It ended up being good that we stayed because we all really enjoyed the food, although that lack of greeting doesn't set a good tone.
