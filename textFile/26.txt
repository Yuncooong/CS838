Bolt
So. Cute. 
I came on a friend date for breakfast & it was precious. The staff is so sweet, recommended the breakfast burrito (which was delicious) and reminded me that coffee refills were only a dollar, which I definitely took advantage of. As an atmosphere, it's super trendy, and seating is few & far between when it's busy, so no worries if you're the person who doesn't wanna dine where it's dead. 

I didn't get to try the baked goods, which I know is a huge thing for Bolt as they do it all in house, but let me tell you, they were staring at me in all their glory & everyone around me was talking about how delicious they were. I have to go back just to check them out.
