The Chairman
I fell in love with the pork belly bun here at The Chairman a few weeks ago after ordering from their food truck.  So, I definitely wanted to try their brick and mortar location off 5th Street near Urthe Caf√©. I recall this location used to be a tow truck yard and used to hear guard dogs bark as you parked near by. This industrial part of area has changed so much and has cleaned up quite a bit.

This location has a small interior but extensive outdoor patio bounded by the old tow truck yard where The Chairman and Son of a Bun food trucks park.
