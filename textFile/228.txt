{The Buffalo Club} looks like your typical bar from the street, but on the inside it is transformed into a restaurant that looks like the [inside of an] old classic railway car. There are burgundy booths, antique mirrors, and mahogany that give off a dark and intimate setting. {The Buffalo Club} also has an outdoor patio where guest can dine among Chinese silk lanterns, [soft lighting] and a beautiful garden setting. This restaurant presents guests with regional American cuisine while taking inspiration from the South, [New England], the Southwest, and California. One of their most popular dishes is the Chicken Pot Pie baked in an old-fashioned biscuit crust and smothered in the chef’s original “Supreme Sauce.”
