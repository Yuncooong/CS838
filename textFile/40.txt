A Food Affair
"Feed your passions, let your fears starve" - I love that along with the rest of the decor of the restaurant! The back outdoor patio is pretty cute too.

I liked everything I ordered on the menu, but if you have to get one thing, get the escargot!!!! So delicious with that sauce.

Service was excellent and the ambience was perfect for a French restaurant!
