Beacon Echo Park 
So happy to have this new spot in the neighborhood! Ordered the crab toast and spam sandwich - both unexpected and delicious. Totally worth the money

I thought the food at the old place (Square One) was always too salty and disappointing.. so Beacon is a welcome change. 

They are still in their soft opening so I am looking forward to trying what's next.
