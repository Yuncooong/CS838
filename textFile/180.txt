Ubatuba Acai - Koreatown
Seriously? This bullshit tiny size of bowl for 7 bucks? And ask for tip on ipad screen? No way. Even paid 15% tip for togo order to beg for an understandable size. Their cup size looks large and there is a common knowledge that if I order the cup, it would be at least half full. However, this place, I tried three times and every single time, their size is complete bullshit and so irregular. Their smoothie size one time was like slightly above half of the cup. Completely dynamic irregular food size for such rip off cost. 1 cup of smoothie for 13 bucks. Damn. Nothing so special or better about this place that justifies the high price. All of their acai comes frozen and even the bowl comes with frozen acai that has been mashed together and frozen in cube whereas their pictures completely bullshit you with non frozen actual acai berries hanging around in the bowl. Bullshit place so rip off
