{Otium} is a contemporary restaurant that draws from the rich culinary heritage of Timothy Hollingsworth. It is designed to be a social restaurant with a dramatic open kitchen merging indoor and outdoor spaces. The restaurant’s name, {Otium}, has its roots in Latin. A word that is meant to emphasize a place where time can be spent on leisurely social activities, both eating and drinking; [adjacent] to one of Los Angeles" most important cultural streets—Grand Avenue—and next to its newest, most vibrant addition, the contemporary art museum, The Broad. The [restaurant] draws inspiration from the 100-year-old olive trees planted in Broad Plaza by utilizing rustic cooking with live fire and sustainable ingredients grown in the garden of the restaurant’s mezzanine. {Otium} strips away the rigid formalities of dining while focusing on the quality of food, warm service, and relaxed casual ambience.
