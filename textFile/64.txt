Han Bat Sul Lung Tang
Perfect comfort food!! This place is tucked into a small part of K-town. There's a good amount of seating inside. There were plenty of workers to get food out and people seated quickly. The menu consists of different meats for your ox bone soup. The options are; mixed, beef brisket, flank, intestine tripe spleen and tongue. 

You start off with 2 banchan. One is spicy kimchi and the other is kakdugi. I ordered the beef brisket one because I wasn't ready to get adventurous quite yet LOL the soup plain but there is salt, green onions and pepper paste for you to flavor it according to your preferences. It was sooo good, I need another bowl soon! Next time, I'd want to try one of the mixed soups!! I'll be back for ya!
