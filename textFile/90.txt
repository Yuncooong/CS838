Bowery Bungalow
One of the more romantic restaurants in the city. Atmosphere and staff are great, and a few of their dishes are unlike anything else you have eaten.

Pomegranate molasses squash with hazelnuts and lebneh makes a great lunch salad, dinner appetizer, or side and finds a way to be really vibrant and refreshing.
