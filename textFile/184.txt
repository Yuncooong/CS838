{Gale’s} Restaurant is a totally local spot. {Gale’s} offers remarkably solid Northern Italian fare just down the road from all the [hubbub]. Couples, [families] and friends that seem to have just finished a day outdoors snuggle among the brick walls and small marble tables, drinking wine from elegant Brighton goblets. Start it off with a Burrata Salad or a steamed artichoke and then move on to the country-style Tuscan steak or one of the house made ravioli specials. For dessert, don't miss the Tiramisu or the Coconut Cake which is uncommonly tasty. The wine list of {Gale’s} is a favorite among the guests for it's variety and excellent value.
