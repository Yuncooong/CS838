Powerplant Superfood Cafe
We ordered our food and when my friend's french toast was delivered it had nuts on top.  Unfortunately, in addition to being gluten free my friend is also allergic to nuts.  The chef came over and worked out a plan to remake her french toast with coconut milk and leave off the walnuts.  She went above and beyond.
