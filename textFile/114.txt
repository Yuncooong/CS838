Hangari Bajirak Kalgooksoo
This place is efficient. You order before you sit down so that they can increase turnover but you can also get your food faster. Not complaining there. The banchan is pretty generic (cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, green onion kimchi). In addition to that, we ordered the mandu (dumplings) and the clam kalgooksoo. (Enough for two people)
