Komodo
 work at a office down the street from this place and just my luck, my favorite kosher deli across the street closed. As I was walking back, hungry and dejected, I stumbled upon Komodo and thank God I did.

I got four tacos (I was hungry) for $10 and they were unreal. I got:
2 komodo tacos- skirt steak with jalapeno aioli, and a corn and radish salad
1 pork taco with fried onion strings and tomatoes or something
1 fish taco with grape salad and onions.
