Parking: about $7 valet parking next door, otherwise, there is some parking around the neighborhood areas. Watch put for the parking limitations and read signs carefully. 

Ambiance: cute, trendy, hip. The line went out the door when we arrived around at 11am. 

Service: workers here are extremely friendly and nice! Super helpful and awesome!
