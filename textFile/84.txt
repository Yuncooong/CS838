Umami Sushi Bar
Well deserved 5 stars!!!!!

This is for sure the BEST & the most Beautiful sushi restaurant in Koreatown (and maybe even larger surrounding areas) among all other sushi or sashimi places. Maybe there is just one other that I know of.

This new restaurant is very well-decorated and the interior is very beautifully done from the wide, clean sushi bar area (they even have a party sushi bar section) to the separated glass-doored dining area to the stylish bar section (they were about to have the liquor license soon) even to the modern restroom near the entrance.

The servers and chefs have good looks which is a plus in the service industry. The staffs are mostly attentive, but need to get better for the much busier time. So far for the brand new restaurant, it is good.
