A Food Affair
Overall, delightful. I've passed by the restaurant many times, but always thought it was just a catering place. After coming here for DineLA at a friend's suggestion, I was pleasantly surprised to find a charming little French restaurant. From the set of glass candy jars in the front to the antique singer sewing machine sinks in the bathroom, you can tell the restaurant put careful thought into the ambiance. The sweet and friendly chef informed us proudly that his daughter was responsible for the decor.

I got to try almost everything on the DineLA menu as I was luckily with two friends happy to eat family style. To start we had the mushroom torte, the escargot in a cream sauce over a baked potato, and the arugula-citrus-blue cheese salad. The best of the bunch was the mushroom tourte: earthy, creamy goodness in a crisp, flaky pastry shell. The salad was fairly basic but was a nice fresh contrast to the heavier tourte and escargot. I also enjoyed that the escargot was unconventionally on a potato, but didn't think it was otherwise memorable.
