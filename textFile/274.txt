The Edmon
Went here for a drink on Friday night at around 6 PM 
it was very relaxed 
there were about two tables having dinner 
we sat at the bar my friend had the Edmond which was a delicious cocktail they're all original creations also which is nice!!!
and the Decour of reminded me of the great Gatsby!!! 
Bar tenders super friendly & knowledgable
And the GM was super polite as well! 
Will return to try food!
