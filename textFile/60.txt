M CON
I was shopping at Macy's and randomly found a Taiwanese restaurant near here! Surprised! Cause I m craving for Asian cuisine! 

I like the decorates and layout. The pattern on the table is very special and pretty. You can choose to seat outer room and the inner space, and for me they give me totally different feeling.
