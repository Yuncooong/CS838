The owners of one of the most criminally overlooked [restaurants in the city] - {Bowery Bungalow} - have opened up a new spot at Sunset and Vine, and given Hollywood a dinner spot that actually isn¡¯t a total production to get into. Much like {Bowery}, {Farida¡¯s} menu is a modern blend of Middle Eastern, [North African], and Mediterranean dishes - all of which are excellent. Think everything from chicken shawarma sandwiches to tahini toast to a baghrir crepe (spongy Moroccan bread). The space is decently sized and extremely colorful, making it a perfect choice for a midweek dinner with friends or a not-predictable first date venue.
