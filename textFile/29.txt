I have never written a bad review for anything in my life but I cannot in good conscious let what I saw go.  First of all, the owner of this restaurant (Marc Kreiner) literally bribes and pays people to write reviews.  He tried to do it to us!  He came up to our table when my boyfriend and I were finishing our meal and and offered us free bread pudding if we would yelp him.  What a joke!  He was so fake and disingenuous I don't know how anyone falls for his game.   But that's just the beginning....

Earlier in the night I mistook the kitchen for the bathroom and accidentally walked back in into the kitchen.  What I saw was the owner Marc standing over a young, scared Hispanic kitchen staff guy screaming the words "ARE YOU STUPID?! DO YOU EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH??" It was so sad, racist and disgusting.  This old, fat white man screaming and belittling this worker scaring him half to death.  I turned around and got the hell out of there but now wish I would have defended that poor man.
