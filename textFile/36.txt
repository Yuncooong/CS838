Corn Man
Overhyped if your Hispanic/Mexican. Being Mexican  I've had esquite (corn in a bowl)/ elote (corn cob on a stick) my whole life. I came on a Friday night and waited 1 hour in line with my boyfriend and a friend. While waiting in line my friend noticed that the toppings were your standard lim√≥n, mayo, butter and cheese, chile optional. So nothing special there. He offers esquite or elote and has soft drinks. The "corn man" prepares your corn and someone else handles the cash. The only thing really going for him is having a location. That's it! He's established a spot where parking is easily accessible and he has his set schedule unlike other "elote people" who usually walk the neighborhood going house to house. His corn is good but it's nothing amazing or extremely outstanding, tbh.
