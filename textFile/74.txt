{Wexler¡¯s Deli} is the new cool kid on the block in [Santa Monica] as chef [Micah Wexler] is redefining [Jewish Deli culture] with his modern take on deli classics. But, this establishment is not entirely new. This is [Wexler¡¯s second deli] under the same name. With rave reviews coming from literally everywhere on his original {Wexler¡¯s Deli} in downtown [L.A.], the famed chef decided to expand westward. And, boy has it turned out well. All of the smoked fish and meats here are brined, cured, smoked and crafted in-house, and served on rye-bread and bagels baked to Chef Wexler¡¯s specifications. His paper thin lox and house smoked pastrami have drawn crowds to his first location in Downtown Los Angeles, so with the new Santa Monica location, fans can still enjoy favorites like The O.G., Reuben, and Ruskie, along with a few new additions to the smoked fish offerings that will only be available in Santa Monica, including Pastrami Lox, Smoked Trout, as well as Dana¡¯s Matzo Ball Soup, and chocolate babka.
