Running Goose
Solid 4 stars because of the value and service (our server, Tommy Lee, was the best!).  Not quite sure about 5 stars many are giving as nothing blew me away, but everything was good,  an interesting mix of flavors, and very reasonably priced.

We shared (for 3):

A pitcher of Red Sangria - A great deal for $20.  Not the best or worst I've had.

Arugula Tostada - avocado, sweet onion, zapaca crema, arugula flowers, queso seco - Pretty underwhelming, just arugula and avocado on a tostada, but for $3, not much to complain about.

Salt Cod Churros - maseca, saffron aioli, lemon, nori - Really interesting. Not too fishy as you might think. Worth trying once.
