Bronzed Aussie
I've only had a drink and dessert here, haven't sampled the meat pies for which they are known...but what I had was amazingly delicious. I love the flavors in the Australian Chai. Recommend asking for a whiff of you are thinking of getting one. It smells delicious. I had mine iced, but was told I was the first to do that. So, hopefully it tastes as good if you try it hot.
