The Pie Hole
$7 for a slice of pie? Yep, I'm definitely in LA. 
Maple Custard pie and Cereal Killer cheesecake? Now I'm definitely in gourmet pie bliss. 

I've visited Pie Hole in Arts District on many occasions, but have somehow always missed the weekend-only Maple Custard and Cereal Killer pies. I was passing through Hollywood this weekend and made a quick pit stop to finally try them.
