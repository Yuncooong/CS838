Gusâ€™s World Famous Fried Chicken
Solid fried chicken. There were four adults in our party, along with four toddlers. We ordered the 12 piece "Snacks" meal, which was nice because we were able to choose exactly which pieces we wanted. My cousin and I are both dark meat people, so we got thighs and wings. Our wives like white meat, so they each got a breast. Then we shared the baked beans, cole slaw, seasoned fries, and mac and cheese, all of which were great.

The thighs and wings were awesome. Hot, juicy, and flavorful. The breasts... not so much. They were definitely overcooked and extremely dry. We weren't impressed whatsoever with those.
