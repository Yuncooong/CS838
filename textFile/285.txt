 liked this place. Service is great. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  The food is amazing!  I don't like onions but their citrus salad that is a mix of blood oranges, pears and onions in white balsamic is incredible. Onions mixed with pears! What an amazing taste. Who'da thought?  

The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is simply the prices. It's tapas portions with these inflated L.A. prices. Two of us had two drinks, split a salad, lobster roll, poke, the fish and dessert. $150 with tip and it wasn't a whole lotta food. The slice of pie at the end seemed bigger than our entire meal. The lobster roll is $11 and it's 2 bites. I eat out A LOT. It's a $60 meal for $150 basically.
