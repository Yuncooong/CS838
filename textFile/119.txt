The Bento Place
This cute little spot reminds me of a premium Korean convenience store! Lots of pre-made bento and sushi options that look fresh. If you eat in store, they will heat up your bentos. I had the eel bento- it was pretty good! Not super filling though, so I would recommend getting it with a roll or sushi on the side. They also have lots of Korean and Japanese drinks (ie canned milk teas). I wish they had a few more snack options though, like egg or dessert types. 
Overall great quick stop for lunch!
