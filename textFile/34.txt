Corn Man
I went on a cool Sunday night after leaving the Staples Center with a Lakers win! What better way to celebrate than to get $2 elotes?!

Recently moved to San Diego from Chicago, I was hoping to find great elotes on almost every corner. To my dismay, San Diego doesn't seem to understand I don't want hot sauce nor tajin on my elotes. I was informed this man in one of the rougher parts of LA, had the goods that I was craving. Bookmarked it, and made it a mission my next trip. 

We got there shortly after he started and there was already a long line of more than 40. Surely it must be great if there's this many dedicated to elotes. The parking lot nearby the cart is fairly well lit and with this many people, it doesn't seem to be of much concern on being in Lincoln Heights. The wait was almost an hour and totally worth it. I prefer mine in a cup, this one comes in a bowl... even better!
