Barcito
5 Stars simply because its a gratuity free establishment. 

All Jokes aside. This is a great place to take a date - although parking sucks and you'll have to look for street parking. 

Dine LA menu for two (29.00 a person)  + 2 drinks each = bill is 112 after tax and you don't tip! 

Drinks AKA CÃ“CTELES - 10 - 13 Dollars
