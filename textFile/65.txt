I was craving Korean food because I had landed in LA from NJ earlier in the day so my friend brought me to Koreatown and recommended this place to me. Forget In-N-Out: I wanted Korean food that evoked memories of home. He told me that this place is known for its ox tail soup so I was very much looking forward to dinner.

We took advantage of parking in the lot in the back and when we walked inside, the place was packed but there was no line. Fortunately, a group of 4 was just leaving as we arrived and the wait time was not even 5 minutes for my party of 5. The waitress was very accommodating and made sure the person on the end was not caught between the waiters/waitresses going in and out of the kitchen.
