Providence
I want to imprint into my head all of it. And keep it there forever. Recall on a whim with perfect recollection, down to the positioning of each blossom on the plates, each sprinkling of dust, each particle of aroma and flavor.

Tragic, isn't it? That we simply can't. That moments are gone almost as quickly as they happen. I was almost at a loss, confounded by this exact dilemma, one fourth of the way through the meal. How to stretch it out forever and fully absorb it into my being? Yes, it was that wonderful.
