I CANNOT believe this restaurant just made the "10 Best New Restaurants" list in Los Angeles Magazine. There is no way that happened without some kickback going on somewhere... it's just not possible. 

Last week I attended on a Friday night with family that are well-versed in dining out - fine, casual, upscale, etc... the point being that we're educated eaters and diners. We were impressed with the bread and the cocktails, and then everything went downhill...

Each dish that came out looked so interesting, but always lacked in modesty; there were always three too many ingredients per dish. Instead of concentrating on flavors or the mix of them, the chef seemed to concentrate on presentation alone - opting for gorgeous colors and combinations when what he needed was palatable dishes.
