Pine & Crane
Hipster Taiwanese cafe! The modern interior of Pine and Crane reminded me more of a cafe that a restaurant. But I loved it! The have wooden communal tables in the middle and then wooden bench/table seating along the wall. Near the entry they have this cute bookshelf that kinda also spreads into the behind the counter area.
