Masa of Echo Park
I was craving some deep dish so deeeeply, so I finally got the chance to go to Masa for my second time (the first being about 4 years back). We came on a Saturday afternoon to find the place still quite busy. You know you're close to Dodgers stadium when you see a sea of white and blue covering Masa's many patrons. 

Every server greets you with a hello and a 45 minute wait warning for any deep dish order, so we quickly decided to order some coffee and an appetizer. I was going to hit blue bottle for some coffee, but was surprised by the selection at Masa, and decided to go with the latte. It was perhaps the lightest latte I've ever had, which isn't a bad thing. But if you're craving some caffeine or some darker/heavier beans, I'd go elsewhere.
