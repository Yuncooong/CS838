Deli-cious Deli & Catering
I come here on a weekly basis, they have the best pastrami in LA. The staff is always friendly and attentive, I'm always so impressed that they know my order before I can even speak it! I appreciate their consistency and would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a great bite to eat.
