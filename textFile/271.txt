The Pie Hole
Took a short trip to LA and came across The Pie Hole as my boyfriend and I walked down Hollywood Blvd. one night. We walked in and stood in a short line and ordered 1 salted caramel pecan pie and 1 philly cheesesteak hand held.

Salted Caramel Pecan Pie - I don't know that I tasted too much of the salted caramel, but maybe the pecans just overpowered it. Either way, i LOVE a good pecan pie, and this tasted like an extra gooey one and I loved it.
