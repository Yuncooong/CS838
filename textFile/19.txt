Jun Won Restaurant
Came to Jun Won for the first time since their relocation. I actually brought the entire family and in-law too! Must say impressed with the new location, very much an upgrade from the old spot still maintaining a vintage Korean feel with a modern twist. As always food was on point, if you look at my pic you will see most the dishes we ordered were clean or on their way to being digested. I have too many favorites to mention but was very happy with the new staff, facilities and my personal favorite the Bossam! I swear I could drink the sauce that comes with it.
