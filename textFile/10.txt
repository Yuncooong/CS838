Mex Per√∫ Gipsy
I'm always on the look out for food places that I don't have in my area so when I saw Peruvian I knew I had to try it! I had the lomo saltado a Peruvian dish with 2 al pastor tacos and a cup of horchata. It was greeeaaaat! The rice was fluffy and the steak and onions, tomatoes, and fries had a wonderful flavor. Felipe the chef definitely knows what he is doing! And Pablo the waiter has to be my favorite waiter of all time. He didn't shy away from talking to me and sharing his favorite salsas with me. They are so in sync with each other it was great to watch them work. I felt welcome there as if I was eating in my mom's kitchen!
