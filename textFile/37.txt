Terra Cotta
The food is amazing and the servers really go out of their way to help you. The restaurant doesn't usually celebrate birthdays. However, the server brought some dessert for my mom to celebrate her.

The food has depth and a variety of  flavors. The interior of the restaurant is super chic and the bar looks phenomenal.

I'm kind of sad to share this review because I'm afraid this place might be crowded and I might never get a table.
