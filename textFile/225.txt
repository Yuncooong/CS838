[Sandwiched] between a temple and a clothing store on West 3rd Street, {A.O.C}. Wine Bar doesn't look like much from the outside. Inside, however, there is a great deal to dazzle the wine and food lovers of Los Angeles. Born of the collaboration between Chef Suzanne Goin and Sommelier Caroline Styne, both of Lucques fame, {A.O.C}. offers a unique dining experience. With the aid of the distinctive cruvinet wine storage system, [Styne can] offer over fifty wines by the glass, half glass, and carafe. Diners can sample from this list while trying some of [Goin's small plates], which vary from traditional wine bar accompaniments, like pate, to the more playful fried chicken.
