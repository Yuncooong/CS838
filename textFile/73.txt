Enjoyed coming here for dinner! Ambience and decor of the place is great!

Our server was excellent and definitely knew the menu well! I really enjoyed her. 

Drinks I got the cider, forgot the exact type but was delicious and not too sweet. 

We ordered the arugula and corn tostada and the salt cod churros. Everything tasted great. Was a little skeptical about the churros, but they're a must try with unique flavor as a savory churro!
