{Salazar}, which opened May 2016, brings elevated [Mexican mesquite] grilled dishes in a space that oozes cool. Brought to Angelenos from co-owner and Chef [Esdras Ochoa] coupled with a bar program from [Brandi Boles], the restaurant focuses on [classic Mexican] flavors with a modern twist. Set on the L.A. river, the concept expands on the former Salazar Mazda garage featuring an open kitchen with great indoor and outdoor seating. At {Salazar}, Chef Ochoa makes hand-made tortillas, while cooking up specialties like their grilled pork chops, carne asada tacos and the frijoles charro. With a great mix of decor and food, it¡¯s a must visit.
