Rodini Park
The chicken and beef shawarma taste great. The salad, tabuleh, and white rice ...not so much. The rice is dry but the tahini sauce made it way better. The tabuleh was also super dry.
I can see myself going here for lunch from time to time if it's on my way. 
I have yet to try dessert from here but they look delicious, especially the baklava cheese cake.
Also, parking can be a hassle to find.
