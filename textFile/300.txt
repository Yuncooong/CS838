Pretty cool guys.

Gets pretty busy and I can see why. The food, although a tad pricey, is tasty. Tasty tasty tasty. I've only tried a couple of items, but so far so good. 

They have a late food night menu that starts at 10pm that offers more shareables at a cheaper price. We ordered the nachos which were large and in charge. The Thai coconut curry ground beef was soooo good I became a fan of ground beef again. It only needed some more chips. Haha ended up scooping the remains with our hands.

They have about 8 pinball machines for two tokens in one room and a bunch of arcade games for one token in the other room. To name a few: donkey kong, Mario Bros, Frogger, Food Fight, Xmen, Tapper, TMNT, Moonwalker, and Tron.
