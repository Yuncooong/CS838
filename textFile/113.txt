Hangari Bajirak Kalgooksoo
Ordered the Manila clam kalguksu (#3) and the dduk bok gi. The portions are huge! The kalguksu had a generous serving of clams and the broth was super comforting since it was so cold outside. The noodles were nicely chewy, and the pumpkin was well cooked too. The dduk bok gi was on the spicier side, but bearable. The fish cakes in it were a little sweet.
