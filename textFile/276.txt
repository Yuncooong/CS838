The Edmon
What a shame. We went with a large group- 14 of us, excited to check out the new spot. First off, we ordered truffle fries- ordinary. Garlic cheese bread- ordinary. Goat cheese and beers- below average. The beats were served warm and the goat cheese, well it was just missing. Then we ordered. After ordering we were told they ran out of chicken dish and the scallops dish. Keep in mind there are only 6-10 items on menu. So we ordered other dishes. Then we are told they ran out of short rib. Now we are really annoyed. Our food came out and the servers (not our waiter but the other servers) did not know whose food was whose. So there was 5 burgers and they didn't know who ordered which one. For dessert time they brought us bread pudding- DELICIOUS (hence by 2 stars) and banana split.  Both were liked very much.
