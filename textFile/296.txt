Beacon Echo Park
So a couple of friends and I decided to try this place out since we were around the area. For first impressions we were not impressed by the dog piss on the floor, and a multitude of flies hanging out by the seating area outside. 

I ordered the salmon toast and while the toast was generously packed with ingredients on top, the actual toast was soggy. The salmon tasted a little too fishy, which made it unappetizing. My friend ordered the same toast and she also stopped eating it after a few bites. 

My other friend ordered the eggs and cheese sandwich and that looked and smelled delicious. He said it was pretty good, and would have been even better if it had bacon in it. But for the one piece of toast, I believe it was $9.
