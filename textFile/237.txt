{Katana} is a chic assault on the senses. Like an industrial, futuristic Zen temple, {Katana’s} steel and wood décor juxtaposes urban grit with delicate sophistication. Its staggering menu presents a delightfully daunting selection of treats, through which diners are free to sample with reckless abandon. {Katana} features two distinctive styles of Japanese cuisine: the familiar sushi bar, and the more novel robata bar, [which features] tapas-like [Japanese barbeque]. Food is sculpted skillfully with almost architectural heights, echoing the artistic details of the surrounding environment. With one of Los Angeles’ only sake sommeliers and a sake selection [as distinguished as] its A-list clientele, {Katana} is a seriously stylish and sensuous experience.
