Hae Ha Heng Thai Bistro
I decided to start with Carla+Marie (Fried Calamari stacked on a wood pole), presentation is fun and taste was excellent (came with two sauces, something like Thousand Islands and  sweet spicy, both very good).I love seafood, thus i opted for the Tom Yum with seafood as the main dish, it was something fantastic (got it with Jasmine white rice on the side). It had mussels, shrimp, fish, scallops. Plus it comes in a bowl that has a center opening with fire under it, so the soup is warm until the last drop.
