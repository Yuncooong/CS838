Yuk Dae Jang
Awesome Korean comfort food! I had the Yuk Kal Guk Soo (Yuk Gae Jang with noodles). The soup had the perfect amount of spice and it was very tasty. The noodles were extremely soft and just melted in my mouth (one of the better noodles and Yuk Gae Jang I had in Korean restaurants in Ktown). I also had the dumplings (both meat and kimchi) and they were very delicious.
