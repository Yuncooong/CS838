Terra Cotta
Eat your heart out Gatsby! Fabulous food, gorgeous ambience, exemplary service...all come together at Terra Cotta under the art deco chandeliers. 

Terra Cotta is the sexy foodie venue that was missing from Koreatown. Where have you been my whole life? I'm sad that I no longer live in ktown, but this just gives me more reason to visit...and a delicious one at that~
