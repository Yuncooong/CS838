Umami Sushi Bar
Amazing sushi at a better entry price than the greats: sugar fish, nobu, matsuhisa. 

The fish is on par with the expensive sushi of Los Angeles at a good price. I'd suggest the nigiri here over other dishes. The fish is a huge portion to the rice, but not too overpowering. 

If you want excellent sushi and don't need to flaunt money to impress, definitely try his place out. The service is very good and accommodating.
