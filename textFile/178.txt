Ubatuba Acai - Koreatown
I'm so used to paying $10+++ dollars for acai bowls. I am loving the reasonable pricing here! You can grab a small acai bowl for $6.50! Nice. And the taste? Delicious. I like everything simple anyway. No need for crazy organic nuts and fruits in there but filling enough to replace a meal. They also sell noonas empanadas here. Which are to die for!!! They are jam packed full of meat. They are 3 for $10. I would recommend anything with jalape√±o and the tomato. My husband had 3 for brunch and didn't eat anything till dinner - very filling!!!
