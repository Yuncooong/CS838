Yuk Dae Jang
This place saved my relationship. Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. But it sure is damn good. ;) I've been dating a guy seriously for a couple years and I've always said one of his biggest flaws is he doesn't like korean food (or sushi... I know right?! How are we still dating?!). Korean food is my favorite! And of all the korean dishes out there, yukgaejang may be #1. My boyfriend had tried yukgaejang at other places before and was convinced he didn't like it. So when I finally dragged him to this place, he was resigned to eating a meal of only white rice. Even so, he ordered the yukgaejang with handmade noodles... and loved it! It's now one of his favorite dishes! We've been back 3 times in as many weeks! I'm so happy I could cry! *blows nose* Thanks, Yukdaejang! Don't ever close!
