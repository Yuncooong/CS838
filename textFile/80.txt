The Carving Board
Order:

Grilled cheese with avocado 
Tomato Soup
Fish and Chips burger with fries 

My boyfriend and I were craving sandwiches on a rainy Sunday and we found The Carving Board on Yelp, so we decided to make the trek in the rain after seeing the positive reviews.  It was our first time and we were excited to try something new. 

There was a problem with my grilled cheese sandwich and so we tried to gently bring it to their attention.  Their customer service was above and beyond.  Jessica, at the front, genuinely apologized, remade the order, and refunded our order in full (most places will only honor 1 of these 2 options).  We were so surprised at how well they treated us. We got our sandwich remade and then even got a free dessert at the end.
