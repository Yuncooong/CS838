The salad was ok, it was just a basic salad. The tongue was good, but I've had way better. The raviolis were tolerable, but the Milanesa was such a huge disappointment. It was like a chicken schnitzel and not a good one. Had a weird raw meat smell to it. It wasn't lightly breaded, it was breaded, but zero seasoning. It came with something that was supposed to be mashed potatoes, but doesn't deserve the title mashed potatoes. How do you mess up mashed potatoes?! The whole thing was so disappointing and the fact that we were the only customers did not help.
