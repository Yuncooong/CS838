Wolf
To say that this is a "hot" restaurant further confirms that increased temperature breeds over hype and mediocre food. Nothing about our meal this evening tells me that come thanksgiving of 2017 this restaurant, hopefully like our orange haired president will remain afoot.

The lamb....flacid

The risotto....gloppy

The burnt carrots....cold 

Not feeling the wolf maybe the coyote will do better 

Bon appetit
