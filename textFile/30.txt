The Morrison
So: The Morrison. So close to Glendale and a Restaurant that i have driven by for years but never stopped.
Well today i stopped and since a friend was visiting from SB we hit the Morrison and regaled in it's many pleasures.
First of all the place is intriguing starting with the impressive entrance. What is this thing called Morrison. Is it a tribute to Jim? Or one to Van? (remember the song, "domino?") I can't answer that even having spent a few hours there today. What i think is happening here is that the owner wanted to create a space in which his customers can feel chill and comfortable and have some good drinks and food and not feel driven to do much except enjoy him or her self.
We arrived at about 12 (they open at noon on Friday) and were greeted by the ballsy "T" someone who was obviously in charge and someone who was not going to let anything get by her. Just the type of person i would want running my restaurant if i owned one.
We sat at the bar  and met Nate, the bartender on duty:  a sweet dude with nothing much on his mind except to give good service. a good thing. Ryan took over later and he was likewise eager and  positive and seemed dedicated to the proposition that the customer comes first.
