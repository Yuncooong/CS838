The Morrison
Absolutely love this place because this is where I met the love of my life. My friends and I went in for some beer and dessert and this is where I realized that stouts were my kind of beer. I was introduced to their specialty beer on tap, the Nutella Stout, and their amazing bread pudding with bourbon flavored ice cream. I initially visited this place because I happened to be in the area, and although the parking is super cramped, there's plenty of residential parking to be found across the street. I later got intrigued by this place even more when it landed 7th place in the top restaurants rated by Yelp in 2016 (or '15?).
