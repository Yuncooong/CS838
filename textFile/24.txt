There is a parking lot outside for convenient lot parking. Came here early 10am on a Sunday and there were quite a few people here. The restaurant seemed fairly new for there were still "grand opening" flower baskets in the front. Over all this place is tiny but spacious. The ambiance is quick, neat, and simple. The decor was also very to the point and simple. That also applied to the menu. All of their side dishes seemed fresh which I really enjoyed. And their food was also very well made in terms of cleanliness and that I genuinely felt like everything had been made to order. The service was great as well. The only reason am giving a four star review though is that I thought the food was a little bland. I prefer my yookehjang really spicy, but it barely had any kick to it at all. But overall the food was good.
