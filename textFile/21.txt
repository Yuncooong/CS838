Jun Won Restaurant
I went to Jun Won's old location three years ago - it's still just as good. Relevant parts of previous review here: "Jun Won has excellent steamed black cod, definitely at least on par with Western Doma's (I can't believe I'm saying this).  At my first bite I was raving, and at my last bite I was raving.  It never got less surprising how stunningly good it was. Cooked to utter perfection - not one minute too long or too short - the white flesh was JUST opaque and somehow both flaky and melty at the same time.  It formed a great color contrast with the bright reddish-brown spicy sauce, which I still maintain is somehow a cousin to mole (despite geographical unlikelihoods). The banchan selection is not quite to my taste - too much pickled everything - but all of it is still high quality (and the tofu is awesome as well as the spicy actual pickles).  The bowl of broth that comes with it is savory and mushroomy, with actual character - usually that type of broth is just filler."
