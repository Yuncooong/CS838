Gok Jee Food
I have been catering Korean food from Mrs. Oh over 7 yrs now.  Her food is very fresh & no msg. So glad she finally takes credit cards now. I order lots of lunch for my customers & it was a challenge when she only accepted cash. Great service & always on time with the delivery. It's always a hit every time I cater from here. I love her Kimchi too. Her Kimchi is so fresh and you can keep it for few wks w/o going too old too fast. My favorite go to dish from here are as follows; Kimbap, ChopChae, Bulgogi, korean Beef meatballs, chicken wings are very popular with most people.
