Button Mash
We had wanted to check this place out for a while, and we were in the area so we did.

When you walk in, you're immediately caught off guard by the wall to wall old-school arcade games. The machines are all in really great condition and they have a broad selection from NBA Jam to Frogger to Rampage. It's a great way to kill time waiting for your table. And each game is only 25 cents, which is nice. There is also a shop attached to the restaurant that sells some cool retro-inspired knick-knacks. 

We went on a Friday. This is not recommended if you're on a time crunch. The hostess told us the wait would be 25-30 minutes. There is self-seated bar space available, but good luck trying to get a spot. After about 50 minutes, we asked for a status on our table. The hostess informed us that we were next, but just as she said that, a spot for 2 people opened up at the bar, so we took that.
