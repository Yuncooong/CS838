Providence
I have dined in L.A. for years, and when this restaurant fell on my radar, I was excited. I am used to dining of this magnitude in Chicago and NY, but never L.A. I have to say that I was very impressed! 
Providence is beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are equally as modern, chic, and clean.
I was celebrating my 40th birthday and decided to go all out and do the Chef's tasting menu. I love that they have a price point for everyone if you are not in the mood to spend $220 on food alone.
Won was my waiter and he was incredible. I really appreciated being able to sub the artisanal cheese selection for the black truffle cheese which was out of this world!! Trader Joe's truffle cheese move over! In addition to the tasting menu, I had to add on the foie gras and it tasted like butter; melted beautifully in my mouth.
Providence also has a stellar wine selection and I was thrilled that they had Heitz Cabernet as a selection as it is one of my favs and rarely seen on the menu by the glass.
I have to say the highlight of the evening was when I spotted Gwendoline Christie walk in! I am a most ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones and was beside myself. For her to dine there, Providence must be the sh** and yaasss, it is!!
