Sulga Jinju Gom Tang House of Beef Soup
My favorite Korean restaurant!  The dogani tang is awesome. The broth is thick and white, just the way I make it at home.  I no longer have to slave in front of the stove for at least eight hours to get such a pure broth.  I can just order take out at Sulga.  Yes!  The kimchi cheegae is a winner too!  You can tell they use quality produce and meats in their soups.  Even their banchans are delicious.  We get take out from Sulga at least once a week.
