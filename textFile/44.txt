Yuko Kitchen
A very cute place in Mid-Wilshire that's charming and quaint. Love how they play old Miyazaki films in the background. It's a nice and cozy space that you wouldn't  expect to find in Mid-Wilshire.

The chicken teriyaki plate is fabulous because of all the stuff you get in it - soup, salad, 3 pastries and even sushi. Everything was prepared well - especially loved the soup, which was some sort of creamy tomato bisque. The flavors were balanced well.

Sushi is also solid - not particularly anything to rave about but pure comfort food.
