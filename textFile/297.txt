Beacon Echo Park 
I stopped by to check it out, maybe get a cup of coffee. Walked in and read the java selection off the board. But then they had a sign that said check out their paper menu for food and other stuff. So I did.

I pretty much stopped when I saw they had a breakfast Spam sandwich. It was the first thing on the menu.
