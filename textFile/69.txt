Pokémolé
We went around 7pm on a Wednesday. There is a small parking lot out in front - key word here is "small" - so we were able to snag a spot right as someone was pulling out.

Their selection for build-your-own-bowl is the best of all the nearby poke places I've tried out. When you look at their huge variety of protein choices (tuna, salmon, albacore, yellowtail, octopus, scallop, shrimp, tofu, tamago?), you get the feeling that you're going to have a hard time deciding on what you want in your bowl. I certainly did, at any rate.
