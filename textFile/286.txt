Son of a Gun
The food is good but it's not a spot I would crave or return frequently.

All the portions are somewhat small and you'll need to spend at least $150 between 2 people to leave somewhat full.

-Fried chicken sandwich: my boyfriend absolutely loved the sandwich. There is so much hype about this sandwich. It is definitely one of the better fried chicken sandwiches I wish the chicken was a little more hot when it came out.
