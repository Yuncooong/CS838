Everything seems great at first - the food is delicious, portion is huge, service is nice, and the place is spacious.But when I bite into the rice that came along with the entree - a piece of stone hidden in it almost broke my teeth, hard. I was in pain but thought it might be from sth else, but my friend's rice is also grainy.
