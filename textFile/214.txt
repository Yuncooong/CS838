{BottleRock’s} philosophy is simple: “passion about wine, beer, food, and the subtle intermingling and fusion of tastes.” [This idea] pervades the entirety of the wine bar’s menu. {BottleRock} presents an extensive wine list alongside an inventive selection of appetizers, entrees, desserts, and cheeses. [The Los Angeles] hotspot has two locations: one in Downtown and the other in Culver City. Both locations are part tasting room, part wine retailer, and part quick bites. {BottleRock} also carries handcrafted beers and sake, and the venue encourages guests to [explore new flavors] and combinations. Their food menu changes seasonally and is presented to patrons within a sleek, chic, and modern décor. Also, {BottleRock} hosts wine tastings, community and private events, and it is available for catering.
