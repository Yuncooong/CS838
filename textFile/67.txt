Pokémolé
Tried this spot out for the first time today, most certainly can say that I am impressed 

I got the Albacore and Spicy tuna burrito, which is bomb af  also got the miso (tasty&includes tofu!)  and made my own bowl-  Great portion size on everything, way more raw fish than other poke spots.  Fantastic vegetable choices and perfect that spring mix is can replace rice, love it. 

The ladies working/owner are extremely friendly.
