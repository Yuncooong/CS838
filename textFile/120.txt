The Bento Place
I tried a crab roll and a salmon roll with yuzu sauce; both were restaurant quality and very tasty.  The chicken fried rice with mixed vegetables was also surprisingly good.  I thought about getting the pork katsu; but, I was worried that the panko crust may be soggy if I took it home and reheated it.  The staff told me if I want to make sure to get a fresh order, I can call in about 25 minutes the next time before I arrive.
