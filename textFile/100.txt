Howlin’ Ray’s
A few friends recommended I check this place out, so I did. We arrived to the site of what seemed to be a never ending line, but that could only mean the place was worth the hype; right? One hour later, I came face to face with the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. I ordered it at a medium spice level, and it was just right. Smokey and spicy, the spice really crept up when you stopped eating, so a steady pace is key. The sandwich itself was huge and I recommend pairing it with some Hot Shake Fries and Comeback Sauce.
