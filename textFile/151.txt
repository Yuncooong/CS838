Han Bat Sul Lung Tang
Perfect comfort food!! This place is tucked into a small part of K-town. There's a good amount of seating inside. There were plenty of workers to get food out and people seated quickly. The menu consists of different meats for your ox bone soup. The options are; mixed, beef brisket, flank, intestine tripe spleen and tongue.
