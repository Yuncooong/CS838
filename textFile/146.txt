Very delicious meat pies! I specifically came here to try the meat pie.  I got the ground beef, which was what was suggested.  It came right out hot and crispy.  The crust was soo crispy and the meat was perfectly seasoned.  Definitely recommend adding ketchup to enhance the flavor.  The service was really good and the food was super delicious.  I would love to come back to try other pies!
