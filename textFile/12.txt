Mex Per√∫ Gipsy
We picked up this place right before starting pregaming and it proved to be a fabulous choice! The people were extremely friendly and welcoming... The owner was wholeheartedly smiling... All the cooking was happening in front of our eyes, which was even more surprising... A real fiesta  that my group needed before a great night...
I definitely recommend this place to everyone that would like to kick-start his trip in a great way!!! Plus the neighborhood surrounding this place is quite interesting to explore during daytime!!! Must-go
