White Boy Tacos
The night we went there was no beef available. There was a deal for 3 tacos so we got the pork, tofu, and chicken. We were not too impressed with the tofu due to the texture and flavor. It was a little dry to us. Pork was good but chicken was fantastic! It was really well marinated and truly if I was ever out that late again, I would get all 3 tacos with chicken... But I still have to try the beef first.
