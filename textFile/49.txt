Man, I miss Campanile - a favorite of mine when I lived in LA.

However, Republique does not disappoint (and I must admit, I feel is even better than Campanile was).  Go here, eat everything.

You absolutely must try the chicken.  I know that sounds boring, but it is incredible and worth every penny.

Other delicious items I'd recommend: the OctoSlaw (octopus salad) and beef tartare (ask for extra potato chips with it).
