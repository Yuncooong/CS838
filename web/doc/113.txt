{Taco María} may be the most unlikely great restaurant in Southern California; a mall place, [descended] from a food truck, with a scattering of rough-hewn tables, a comfortable patio and piles of Mason jars in {Taco María}. It would be easy to mistake {Taco María} for a genteel enchilada place instead of a [restaurant] with a $75 prix-fixe tasting menu and a young chef, Carlos Salgado, esteemed by some of the finest culinary minds in both California and Mexico.
