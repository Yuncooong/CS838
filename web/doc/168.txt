Not much has changed at {Chateau Marmont} since it opened in 1927 as a remake of the Chateau d’Amboise in France. Even after a renovation by Andre Balazs, the character, charm and beauty of the hotel remain intact. And the [place] is as bustling with celebrities as it ever was. {Chateau Marmont} is a Los Angeles landmark and Hollywood icon that has starred in films (like Sophia Coppola’s Somewhere) and [even art] exhibits (James Franco made a grand scale replica of the hotel for his 2012 MOCA exhibit, Rebel Without a Cause). {Chateau Marmot} are great for grabbing a bite or sip while rubbing elbows with A-list celebs.
