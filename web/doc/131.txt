QUICK PITCH Right out of the gate the most ambitious and accomplished restaurant in Hollywood by a mile, TV chef Curtis Stone’s [successor] (with brother Luke) to the far tinier Maude in Beverly Hills is [likewise] tasting-menu-only. The five-course dinner in the modern-Deco dining room, which begins with a [selection] of housemade charcuterie, is anchored by what’s broken down at their adjacent custom-and-cut butcher shop (lamb, duck) and then cooked multiple ways. Ben Aviram, previously at The French Laundry and Alinea, runs the wine program in {Gwen}. 
INSIDE DISH {Gwen}, like {Maude}, is named after Stone’s grandmother.
