QUICK PITCH A former auto body shop in Atwater Village next to the revitalizing Los Angeles River has been converted into a stylish indoor-but-mostly-outdoor ode to mesquite-grilled Mexican cooking: tacos, frijoles, esquites, the occasional heirloom tomato salad. All about al fresco, {Salazar’s} hang-loose patio offers both surprisingly cheap beer and serious cocktails, the latter from {Aaron Melendrez}, who’s also behind the bar program at {The Normandie Club}.
INSIDE DISH {Modernica}, the massive [industry] prop house (a favorite of Mad Men), is a block away.
