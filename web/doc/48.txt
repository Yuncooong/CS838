{Silver Lake's} new [locals' hangout] has arrived. {Wolfdown} is a more formal restaurant from the people behind [neighborhood] spot Forage - and by more formal we mostly mean you don't order at the counter here. The old bungalow space on {Rowena} is beautiful, and has a back patio you¡¯ll be spending half your summer nights on. The menu is definitely eclectic - patatas bravas and Korean fried chicken are both present - but the food itself is tasty and unfussy, and the whole place feels like that one really fun [friend's] place you always end up at.
