Something big is happening, and it¡¯s going down in Frogtown. No, that¡¯s not the name of a section in Disneyland, it¡¯s an actual LA neighborhood, and home to an extremely exciting new spot: {Salazar}. [The] massive space is almost entirely outdoors, [with] a menu featuring everything from a mesquite-grilled trout to carne asada quesadillas - but you're going to want to go heavy on the [tacos], because they're incredible.
