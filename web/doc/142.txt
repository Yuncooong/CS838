{Tavern} is the third restaurant from the chef and sommelier team of Suzanne Goin and Caroline Styne, who also own Lucques [restaurant] and AOC winebar. This is their West Los Angeles outpost, which serves as a local gathering spot for the Brentwood crowd. Chicly designed by Jeffrey Alan Marks, {Tavern} encompasses three separate, yet connected spaces: a glass roofed atrium dining room, a large blue walled bar and a café space called the Larder that [features casual] dining, bakery, retail and prepared foods to go. {Tavern} serves Suzanne Goin’s signature California/Mediterranean cuisine with just a touch of a classic American influence.
