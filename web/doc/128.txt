QUICK PITCH This grand Koreatown dining room {Terra Cotta} turns the address next to the Art Deco Wiltern theatre into a destination for the first time since top L.A. chef Josef Centeno made his name at Opus more than a decade ago. It's spectacle presentation executed with care – truffled toro tataki; anticucho hamachi collar; and the coup de grace: squid ink, garlic and kimchee fried rice studded with dayboat scallops and Argentinian prawns. 
INSIDE DISH {Terra Cotta} arguably lays [claim] to the longest, largest restaurant bar in the city – with an extensive, glowing liquor cabinet to match.
