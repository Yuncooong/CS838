There was no better place to see and be seen in 2016 than {Catch}. The West Hollywood newbie has [become] what The Ivy was 15 years ago, or what Chasen’s was a generation before that. If you can make it [past] the battalion of [paparazzi] crowding the entrance you will be whisked quickly upstairs and onto this rooftop beauty. {The truffle sashimi} is a decadent dish that combines tuna with caviar and black truffle. The lobster mac and cheese (by no means of the sweatpants-at-home-with-Netflix variety) is made with mascarpone and parmesan cheeses and fresh Maine lobster. There is a reason for {Catch’s} dress code.
{Catch} is located at 8715 Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood. (323) 347-6060
