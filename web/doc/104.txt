{Hollywood Blvd}. in Los Feliz already had a killer daytime game (see: Homestate and Go Get ‘Em Tiger), but things have gotten completely out of hand with the arrival of {Kismet}, {Tsubaki }. This day-to-night spot is brought you by the teams behind Madcapra and Animal, and has a vegetable-focused, [Middle Eastern]-inspired menu that’s full of everything we want to eat right now. The broccoli toast will make you forget about avocado toast altogether, and if you don’t order the flaky bread you’ve made a grave mistake. While lunch is our favorite time of day to be in this light-filled spot, dinner involves a rabbit feast for two that shouldn’t be written off. You need to be eating here.
