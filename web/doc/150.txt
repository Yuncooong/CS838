{Taste at the Palisades}, sister restaurant to Taste on Melrose, now resided just off Sunset Blvd a [stones throw] from PCH. With its relaxed setting, homey yet sophisticated, the menu offers updated Californian [comfort cuisine] for eminently moderate prices. The menu of {Taste at the Palisades}, split equally between appetizers and entrees, includes seasonal finds like white truffle mac 'n' cheese, salads and pizzettas. The unusual but simple starter of grilled romaine lettuce topped with gorgonzola, applewood smoked bacon and Granny Smith apples is a must-try. Main-course highlights like Kobe beef burger and crispy parmesan chicken paillard atop garlic potato puree. 

{Taste at the Palisades} offers everything that people are looking for in a neighborhood restaurant - namely good food and friendly service.
