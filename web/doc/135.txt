I came {A Food Affair} last night for Valentine's Day and was very excited to try the French onion soup, their chicken [dish], and the creme brûlée. I was kinda shocked on how they had a fixed menu for the night and a fixed price. I wish I was told this when I was called for confirmation. I would of picked a different day to come in, so I could try the things in {A Food Affair} I was most interested in.
