2016 saw the continued rise of the neighborhood restaurant. {Café Birdie} is exactly the sort of elevated bistro we all want down the street. The menu of {Café Birdie} is full of comfort foods, but with the [occasional] unexpected flourish. A plate of fried chicken tastes of Moroccan spices, and comes with a red harissa dipping sauce. Grilled trout uses olives to balance out the fish’s brine, and pickled haricot vert for extra acidity. Both of the restaurant’s bars (the one in the main dining room, and the detached back-bar Good Housekeeping) deliver some serious cocktails, yet [never] feel intimidating. The same could be said of the entire {Café Birdie} experience: warm, inviting, and enjoyable on every visit.
{Café Birdie} is located at 5631 N Figueroa Street in Highland Park.
