{Kali} is the passion project of long-time friends and professional colleagues Chef [Kevin Meehan] and Drew Langley, formerly the Wine Director at the {Michelin-starred restaurant} Providence. Evolving from [Kevin¡¯s] roving private dinner party pop-up, {Kali} Dining, {Kali} features produce that comes directly from Kevin¡¯s own home garden, and the gardens of his neighbors who also contribute their seasonal bounty whenever possible. Their signatures dishes include a beet tartar, [charred avocado], black cod, and a black barley risotto, while Kevin¡¯s signature meringue gelato made using egg yolks that have been cured in salt and sugar for fourteen days, are a must-have to finish your meal.
