To many people [a chef and an artist] are one in the same. This is absolutely true of Chef Jordan Kahn of {Red Medicine} located in Beverly Hills on Wilshire boulevard and South Gale drive. The concept of {Red Medicine} was cooked up during late nights in Chinatown dives after grueling 18-hour restaurant shifts. It is not classic Vietnamese food, nor is it trying to be. {Red Medicine} is something new with a tip of the hat to old Vietnam. A dish like the Pork contains traditional Asian ingredients, [spring onion], and Sriracha, but the caramelized pork is taken in a whole new direction with the addition of goji berry, and a powder of dried almonds. The [signature Dungeness Crab] plate contains flakes of sweet crab meat, black garlic and brown butter buried under a Vietnamese crepe veil. Taste the Bitter Chocolate masterpiece, airy triangles of unsweetened chocolate resting on a streak of sweet soy sauce, soy milk sorbet, and a bright yellow vine of parsnip gelatin, and patrons will experience a [dessert beyond expectations]. The kitchen is [Chef Kahnâ€™s] studio and the stark white plates are his canvas.
