Taking over the popular {Scarpetta} restaurant within [the Montage Hotel] is no easy feat. So, Chef [Geoffrey Zakarian], The Food Network star and [New York City chef], had a serious undertaking to make a hit out of this new restaurant. Zakarian brought the new {Georgie Restaurant} to overtake the space, and the renowned chef and restaurateur has hit it out of the park. Featuring Modern American cuisine, the menus showcase locally-sourced ingredients perfectly melded with seasonal influences. The lush space of the restaurant, which is centrally situated in Beverly Hills¡¯ Golden Triangle, creates a playful setting both indoors and out while serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Whether Angelenos want to stop by for a casual lunch, a power business lunch, or for a fashionable dinner, it¡¯s the perfect place to enjoy delicious eats from a tasty menu. Zakarian leaves no doubt that {Georgie} is the new place to be in Beverly Hills.
