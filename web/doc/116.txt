While {Howlin’ Ray’s} was already a popular food truck before opening a brick-and-mortar this year, it should be noted that lines are over an hour long from the moment the doors open and stay that way until they close. Why? Because chef Johnny Ray Zone has mastered the one item on his menu: Nashville-style [hot chicken]. To start in {Howlin’ Ray’s}, Zone (formerly of La Poubelle) has crafted a spice blend that is no doubt one of the spiciest you’ve ever tasted (the two highest heat levels use Carolina Reaper peppers and Ghost peppers), while any heat level is expertly balanced with notes of sweetness and umami. The chicken, free-range birds sourced locally from Mary’s, is itself not to be overlooked. Whether you order a fried chicken sandwich, chicken wings, or the breast, the bird is always [juicy and tender]. Crinkle-cut fries are a nice side order, and the comeback sauce and coleslaw are a welcomed topping (read: coolant) when chowing down on a meal that will leave you sweating even on the coldest days of winter.
{Howlin’ Ray’s} is located at 727 N Broadway #128 in Chinatown. (213) 935-8399.
