{STK} artfully blends two concepts into one—the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge. A large central lounge area is [furnished] with creamy leather banquettes and textured crocodile tiles, and is surrounded by an [elevated] dining room for more formal dining. Theatrical lights illuminate each table, while smoky mirrors allow patrons to catch a glimpse of the surroundings while a DJ creates an energetic vibe throughout the entire space. {STK} Los Angeles is located in the heart of Westwood at the W Hotel Los Angeles- West Beverly Hills. As anticipated, steak is the main attraction. {STK} offers small, medium and large cuts of meat, as well as naturally raised options and market fresh fish entrees. Aside from steak, signature items include Parmesan Truffle Fries; Lil’ BRGs; Shrimp Rice Krispies; Sweet Corn Pudding; and Jumbo Lump Crab Salad.
