Nick {Erven} has returned to full form with this eponymous Santa Monica spot. {Erven}, whose much-lauded Saint Martha closed in late 2015, debuted his new vegetable-centric project only a few months later. The [setting] is relaxed, and the food is playful: combining flavors and ingredients into forms and textures that will keep you drooling. {Erven} loves to take dessert items and repurpose them as a main course. Youâ€™ll find savory donut holes as an appetizer option replete with [sauerkraut] and a delicious applesauce topping. Ordering a plate of beets will reveal beet sorbet along with pickled beets, avocado mousse, and streuseled almonds. Nick {Erven} has established a winning argument for why non-vegans should stop rolling their eyes at a menu of vegetables.
{Erven} is located at 514 Santa Monica Boulevard, #516 in Santa Monica. (310) 260-2255
