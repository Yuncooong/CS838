Sure, you¡¯ve been to strip malls for sushi, [but] for high-end tasting menus? Not so much (other than {Trois Mec}). {Kato} is here to change that, with a five-course Japanese and Taiwanese-inspired menu (a steal at $49). Expect things like hamachi with a charred scallion sauce or a [sukiyaki-inspired soup]. Whatever you do, definitely go for the pork belly rice add-on. They're still working on their liquor license, but you won't even notice the lack of booze when the food is this good.
