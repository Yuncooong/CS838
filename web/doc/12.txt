I always drop back in on these lists to get a quick overview. But don¡¯t understand how pretty consistent restaurants like {Jun Won} and {Canele} which have been around so long, go on and off the list. Course, to each his own. {Canele} is one of my favorite restaurants¡­ I tried the new lunch there and don¡¯t like it as much as dinner and brunch, but that¡¯s my experience. The risotto like rice at lunch was awesome though.

No Sapp Coffee House? And for me, {Chunju Hanilkwan} edges {Jun Won}. But {Jun Won} has a greater number of [dishes] and side dishes that are quality than Chunju. Also, the owner at {Jun Won} has really gone out of his way to make our meals awesome. Generations.

I know [these restaurants] are far. But I really enjoyed my first meal at {Borneo Kalimantan} and am going back. {Lu¡¯s Garden} and {India¡¯s Flavor} are also some personal favorites of mine, which are outside of [LA] but highly suggest!
