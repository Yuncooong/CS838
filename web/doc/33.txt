{Domino's} may be the most hated pizza place in [Los Angeles]. Mostly, the problem seems to be that delivery takes too long. Octavio L.(who lives all the way [in Monrovia]) is loyal to another chain and says this {Domino's} has, "horrible customer service, and inconsistent menu options and food! Manager was a jerk to me and my friend ... [pizza hut] from now on!" Meanwhile, Tiffany V. was shocked: "Pizzas were blackened. I'm talking rock-hard and charred. I couldn't even attempt to eat them. Really? Does no one do a basic quality check before sending orders out at this place?"
