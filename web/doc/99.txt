If you have spent any amount of time eating in [L.A.'s] small but robust Little Ethiopia neighborhood, you might be familiar with the cooking of Tenagne Belachew, a matronly grandmother from a small town in northern Ethiopia. She's cooked in the community for more than a decade, at Little Ethiopia stalwarts Rahel and Marathon. Over the years Belachew has attracted something akin to a cult following among local diners, and when she arrives at your table at {Lalibela}, brandishing a sizzling platter of derek tibs (butter-sauteed cubes of beef flecked with herbs), you'll understand why her new restaurant already has amassed a roomful of dinner regulars. {Lalibela} serves many of the Ethiopian staples common everywhere, but its delicate, subtly spiced details set it apart. There are crispy, house-made sambusas, triangle-shaped pastries filled with lentils and onions and paired with a swipe of bright green jalape?o sauce. A deeply entrancing version of Ethiopia's national dish, doro wot, is a dark, formidable stew fortified with [poached chicken] and hardboiled eggs; it easily could be mistaken for a soul-stirring variation of Oaxacan mole. {Lalibela} is the type of family-run jewel you might dream about encountering, a place where recipes are passed down through several generations, and the grandmother in the kitchen tends to pots that have been simmering for days. 1025 S.
