The problem at this [West LA] pizza joint appears to be its inconsistency with delivery. Jesse H. lays it out, "Basically, you order your food and it takes upwards of two hours for your meal to arrive." Tk K. says {Pantry's Pizza} was all a bad dream, "Would leave zero stars if i could. {Pantry's Pizza} was a [nightmare] dealing this establishment." And Matt A., 'who never leaves reviews,' leaves a warning: "This place is extremely dirty and the food is terrible. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS."
