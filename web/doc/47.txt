Is this the fanciest restaurant in [Koreatown]? Yes, by a mile. The [people] behind Ktown¡¯s most well-known BBQ spot ({Kang Ho Baekjeong}) rolled the dice in a big way and opened this massive, upscale restaurant next to a {Denny¡¯s} on Wilshire. Guess what? It paid off. The Korean-American menu might not be cheap, but everything from the uni rice to the [hamachi] to the steak tartare is worth it. Also, the cocktail situation is strong (and there's a separate bar where you don't have to order food) in case you¡¯re stopping by for a quick drink before a concert at the nearby {Wiltern}.
