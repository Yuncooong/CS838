When one of [LA¡¯s] great pasta spots ({Angelini Osteria}) opens up a new restaurant, you pay attention. When you find out it¡¯s a casual all-day cafe, you rejoice. Located directly next to the original restaurant [on Beverly], {Alimentari} is dishing out affordable sandwiches (get the meatball sub), salads, [coffee], and Italian gelato for all your mid-afternoon needs. The excellent outdoor patio doesn¡¯t hurt either.
