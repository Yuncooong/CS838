At {Erven}, former {Saint Martha} chef Nick {Erven} is proving that limitations only spur creativity. Omnivorous chefs making plant-based cuisine is perhaps the year's biggest trend ({Erven's} website calls it "coincidentally vegan"), but {Erven} makes a particularly compelling case for eschewing meat, pulling from ingredients flavors and textures that you didn't know they had.

The all-day restaurant serves creative [pastries and juices] and a bunch of [salads] during the day, but the nighttime menu is where the real thrills lie. Kale cavatelli comes in a stunningly bright "tom yum gravy," along with squash, hen of the woods mushrooms and pears. Soft, wobbly tofu is paired with lightly charred Brussels sprouts and doused in a pickled-garlic ponzu sauce. This chef loves acid, and uses it to great effect. Even on a chickpea fritter turned dark with black garlic, the flavor that really sets the dish ablaze is the yuzu that dances at its edges. Add a fun wine list and service that is sometimes pitch-perfect, and you've got a restaurant that could very well act as the poster child for this new, thrilling era of plant-focused eateries. 514-516 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica.
