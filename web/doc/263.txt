West Hollywood’s {Comme Ca} gives Angelinos the experience of dining in a French bistro with West Coast flair. Chef David Myers opened the restaurant as a way to share his dream of the perfect brasserie experience with the dining public. House signature cocktails such as the Penicillin, [Cool Louie], and [El Ranchero are] bar favorites when warming up for the meal to come. The menu features many French favorites like Fruits de Mer (Oysters on the half shell) and Escargots Persillade for Hor d’Oeuvres. Other meal openers include the Roasted Baby Beet Salad, Assiette de Fromage du Jour as well as House made Charcuterie. Plats du Jour are available all week from Mondays [Whole Roasted Chicken] to Sundays Heritage Pork Chop. It has been said the the {Comme Ca} Burger is the best in Los Angeles, but that is up to each diner to decide for themselves. {Comme Ca} offers a taste of Paris in the heart of West Hollywood.
