{Loqui} on the Westside can be a pretty hit-or-miss proposition. {Loqui}, the casual order-at-the-counter taco spot in the [Culver City¡¯s] Platform development, is here to change that. The menu is limited - it¡¯s either [tacos] (with house-made tortillas) or snazzy burrito bowls they call molcajetes, and you can¡¯t go wrong with either. Scratch that - if you don¡¯t sprinkle the dry salsa and chile on top of everything, you are wrong.
