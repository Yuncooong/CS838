Attention everyone waiting in line at {Tatsu on Melrose}: there¡¯s a brand new ramen spot down the street that¡¯s just as good, [with zero wait time]. {EAK} took over the (very sadly) defunct Pingtung market, but has given the neighborhood another ramen joint it clearly needed. So what makes {EAK} different than the rest? It¡¯s ¡°lekei¡± style, which [means] much thicker noodles than you¡¯re used to and a broth that¡¯s noticeably saltier. Our move is the Oh So Spicy (because it¡¯s actually spicy) and the ginger gyoza because you never don't order [the gyoza].
