Just off Robertson Boulevard nestled in the heart of Beverly Hills lies one of Los Angeles’ premium Moroccan restaurants, {Tagine}. A fusion of old and new recipes combine to create both their ala cart and tasting menus. Each dish is carefully hand crafted and the menu is always seasonally fresh. An eclectic combination of beers and wines follow their ever-changing menu. Chef [‘Ben’ Benameur] says about his restaurant, “all I want is a warm place where the food is made with love” and with [such an intimate] location and cozy ambience he has made this simple statement a reality. For those in search of a taste of Mediterranean North Africa, {Tagine} is the only fine dining Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills.
