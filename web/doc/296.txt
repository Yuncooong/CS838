Famed Chef [Todd English] pairs up with Hollywood darling Eva Longoria Parker to introduce us to {Beso}, a glamorous and refined restaurant serving up [fine fusion cuisine] with a side of glitz nightly. Step into {Beso} and be seduced by the lush and invocative palette of deep crimsons, rich wood tones, and alluring leather upholstery. The menu infuses Latin-inspired flavors with [Middle-Eastern flare] for a tantalizing array of meat and seafood selections. Evaâ€™s Tortilla Soup is a comforting bowl of spice and the {Beso Paella} is an invigorating melding of surf and turf. Every bite glistens like the crystal chandelier hanging overhead.
