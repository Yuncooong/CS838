QUICK PITCH Eagle Rock’s young-family Togetherness demo gets its date-night prayers answered with this stylishly accessible, lively-but-not-rowdy offering from chef-owner Dave Woodall. (The place has the sophisticated-homey neighborhood spot feel of Blair’s in Silver Lake, where he used to work.) Woodall’s seasonal New American fare is simultaneously on-trend and timeless: [house-made] ricotta toast, butter lettuce salad with thick cuts of bacon, buttermilk fried chicken and [waffles]. Ask for a table on the second floor overlooking the street in {Red Herring}.
INSIDE DISH Co-owner Alexis Martin Woodall – Dave’s wife – has been Ryan Murphy’s longtime producer, from Nip/Tuck and Glee to Scream Queens and American Horror Story.
