Considered one of LA’s most romantic restaurants, it’s no surprise that the city’s A-listers take their dates to {The Little Door}. The space is divided into the patio, winter garden, piano room and blue room, each [channeling] the charm and [glamor] of the Mediterranean. In recent Hollywood gossip, Robert Pattinson and a “mystery blonde” visited {The Little Door} and dined in the patio for hours. Enjoy at {The Little Door}!
