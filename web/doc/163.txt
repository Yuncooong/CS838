{POP Champagne Bar & Restaurant} is a warm and welcoming place where friends gather for good times and where dates enjoy a romantic setting. {POP} is located in Old Pasadena in a historic building that retains many of its original features — brick walls, plank floors, an open- beam ceiling, and Batchelder tiles. 

{POP’s} dinner menu starts with [appetizers] like jalapeño tuna tartare and beer-battered vegetables, and [goes] on to include entrée favorites such as champagne chicken, a morel risotto, and filet mignon with truffle mashed potatoes. It also includes salads, cheese and charcuterie platters, and small plates such as pommes frites and a seasonal soup. Our much-praised dessert menu presents classics such as crème brûlée and a soufflé du jour, as well as inventive temptations such as a Meyer lemon tart with homemade basil ice cream. All of our offerings are made in-house, including our breads.
