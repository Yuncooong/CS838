QUICK PITCH The entertainment industry’s go-to downtown L.A. destination restaurant is situated in the warehouse-strewn Arts District, just west of a still-dystopian stretch of the Los Angeles River. The [incredibly] loud, reliably accomplished, contempo-agro rustic Italian concept – where tattoos and tagliatelle appear to be worshipped in equal measure – is best known for its wood-fired pizzas and [handmade] pastas. Don’t miss the smoked chicken liver pate in {Bestia}.
INSIDE DISH By far the oldest spot on this list, {Bestia}, which opened in late 2012, remains an impossible Saturday dinner reservation (at least at a non-absurd hour) – unless, of course, someone has a connection.
{Bestia} 2121 E.7th PI.
